For film in Northern Ireland, see Cinema of Northern Ireland.The Irish film industry has grown somewhat in recent years thanks partly to the promotion of the sector by Bord Scannán na hÉireann (Irish Film Board) and the introduction of heavy tax breaks. According to the Irish Audiovisual Content Production Sector Review carried out by the Irish Film Board and PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2008 this sector, has gone from 1,000 people employed six or seven years ago, to well over 6,000 people in that sector now and is valued at over €557.3 million and represents 0.3% of GDP.According to an article in Variety magazine spotlighting Irish cinema, a decade ago Ireland had only two filmmakers anyone had heard of: Neil Jordan and Jim Sheridan. As of 2010, Ireland can boast more than a dozen directors and writers with significant and growing international reputations. Ireland is now achieving critical mass of filmmaking talent to match the kind of influence, disproportionate to its small size, that it has always enjoyed in the fields of literature and theatre. Following in the footsteps of Sheridan and Jordan comes a generation that includes such directors as Lenny Abrahamson, Conor McPherson, John Crowley, Martin McDonagh, John Carney, Kirsten Sheridan, Lance Daly, Paddy Breathnach and Damien O'Donnell and writers such as Mark O'Rowe, Enda Walsh and Mark O'Halloran.Former Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen (2008–2010) said that “the film industry is the cornerstone of a smart and creative digital economy”.[8] But as well as the concrete economic benefits that the Irish film industry brings in by way of cash investment from overseas and the associated VAT, PAYE and PRSI receipts, it has been noted that there are the soft benefits in terms of the development and projection of the Irish culture and the promotion of tourism.While big-budget international productions keep crews working and are enormously valuable to the country, it is the indigenous industry that is at the heart of creating opportunity and giving skills and experience to Irish producers, directors, writers and crew, telling the stories that emerge from Irish-based talent.[10] Some of the most successful Irish films include The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), Intermission (2003), Man About Dog (2004), Michael Collins (1996), Angela's Ashes (1999), The Commitments (1991) and Once (2007). Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie (2014) holds the record for the biggest gross on the opening day of an Irish film in Ireland.[In the past many films were censored or banned, owing largely to the influence of the Catholic Church, although virtually no cuts or bans have been issued in recent years, one as of August 2006. The Irish Film Censor's Office policy is that of personal choice for the viewer, considering his job to examine and classify films rather than censor them.]","path":[82681,-10.15639,51.56133,82522,-10.14787,51.56225,82391,-10.1409,51.56305,82172,-10.12917,51.56436,82011,-10.12047,51.56528,81852,-10.11174,51.56628,81701,-10.10342,51.56719,81542,-10.09467,51.56815,81392,-10.08647,51.56903,81251,-10.07874,51.56999,81101,-10.07051,51.57101,80960,-10.06283,51.57196,80812,-10.05472,51.57295,80662,-10.04655,51.57396,80510,-10.03828,51.57497,80362,-10.03021,51.57621,80222,-10.02267,51.57762,80090,-10.01611,51.57969,79941,-10.00848,51.58194,79801,-10.00135,51.58405,79661,-9.994105,51.58614,79511,-9.986267,51.58839,79292,-9.97484,51.5917,79142,-9.967112,51.59392,78932,-9.95625,51.59705,78790,-9.94937,51.59926,78572,-9.939379,51.6027,78430,-9.93349,51.60534,78270,-9.929132,51.6099,78141,-9.926525,51.61384,77849,-9.922645,51.62145,77712,-9.920888,51.62416,77571,-9.91892,51.62701,77422,-9.916955,51.63,77281,-9.914945,51.63262,77071,-9.912512,51.63629,76930,-9.910653,51.63863,76712,-9.908905,51.64266,76571,-9.908468,51.64511,76431,-9.9079,51.64727,76260,-9.906413,51.64897,75880,-9.905407,51.64903,74632,-9.90537,51.64909,73351,-9.905401,51.64906,72061,-9.905416,51.64899,70752,-9.905427,51.64903,69392,-9.905392,51.649,68151,-9.905407,51.64905,66871,-9.9053,51.64905,65571,-9.905398,51.64905,64201,-9.905372,51.64901,62841,-9.905383,51.64901,61491,-9.90537,51.64902,60161,-9.905372,51.64899,58781,-9.90543,51.64901,57471,-9.905363,51.64897,56141,-9.905392,51.64906,54782,-9.90535,51.64899,53361,-9.90541,51.649,51990,-9.905367,51.649,50602,-9.905343,51.64899,49261,-9.905376,51.64914,47922,-9.905374,51.64899,46562,-9.9054,51.64901,45162,-9.905327,51.64902,44910,-9.905369,51.649,43521,-9.905365,51.64902,42151,-9.905356,51.64902,40801,-9.90537,51.64905,39461,-9.905369,51.64905,38102,-9.905395,51.64905,36822,-9.905372,51.64901,35432,-9.905407,51.64905,34112,-9.905414,51.64902,32860,-9.905388,51.64902,31511,-9.905425,51.64903,30181,-9.905396,51.64907,28841,-9.905401,51.64902,27561,-9.905408,51.64901,26191,-9.905358,51.64909,24901,-9.905385,51.64902,23551,-9.905376,51.64907,22222,-9.905233,51.64892,20871,-9.905418,51.64908,19531,-9.905349,51.64904,18192,-9.905365,51.64903,16821,-9.905421,51.64907,15491,-9.905338,51.64902,14141,-9.905367,51.64905,12781,-9.905349,51.649,11440,-9.905408,51.64904,10061,-9.905421,51.64906,8732,-9.905305,51.64899,7402,-9.905355,51.64904,6072,-9.905401,51.64904,4740,-9.905336,51.64903,3400,-9.905415,51.64904,2062,-9.905388,51.64902,751,-9.905395,51.64899]},{"name":"RNLI LIFEBOAT 17-44","text":"RNLI LIFEBOAT The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is the largest charity that saves lives at sea around the coasts of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as well as on some inland waterways. There are numerous other lifeboat services operating in the same area. Founded in 1824 as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, the RNLI was granted Royal Charter in 1860 and is a charity in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Queen Elizabeth II is Patron. The RNLI is principally funded by legacies and donations with most lifeboat crew members being unpaid volunteers. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and operates 444 lifeboats. Crews rescued on average 22 people a day in 2015. RNLI Lifeguards operate on more than 200 beaches. They are paid by local authorities, while the RNLI provides equipment and training. The Institution operates Flood Rescue Teams (FRT) nationally and internationally (iFRT), the latter prepared to travel to emergencies overseas at short notice. Considerable effort is put into training and education by the Institution, particularly for young people; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. The Institution has saved some 140,000 lives since its foundation, at a cost of more than 600 lives lost in service. Sir William Hillary came to live on the Isle of Man in 1808. Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast, he drew up plans for a national lifeboat service manned by trained crews. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty. However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, with the help of Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert, the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824. At the age of 60, Sir William took part in the 1830 rescue of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. He commanded the lifeboat and was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. It was this incident which prompted Sir William to set up a scheme to build The Tower of Refuge on Conister Rock – a project completed in 1832 which stands to this day at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. In 1854 the institution's name changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (in 1849 Prince Albert had added his support to the Institution[1]) and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of the work of Sir William.1974 postage stamp marking the RNLI's 150th anniversary (rescue of Daunt Lightship's crew by Ballycotton lifeboat RNLB Mary Stanford. Artist: B. F. Gribble)In its first year the RNLI raised £10,000, however by 1849, income had dropped to £354.[3] Finding itself in financial difficulties, the RNLI accepted a government subsidy of £2,000, which rose in subsequent years. This lasted until 1869, when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies; in addition, the government's imposition of bureaucracy and regulations were detrimental to the service.[4] It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new impetus to fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £10,000. The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year.","path":[82165,-9.907898,51.65185,80824,-9.907904,51.65187,79445,-9.907937,51.65183,78056,-9.907831,51.65182,76656,-9.907917,51.65183,75325,-9.907851,51.65187,73976,-9.907788,51.65188,72515,-9.907866,51.65189,71225,-9.907842,51.65189,69845,-9.907891,51.65187,69725,-9.907162,51.65151,69595,-9.907148,51.65057,69335,-9.90789,51.65175,69194,-9.907703,51.65162,69015,-9.906593,51.65087,68874,-9.906384,51.64986,68725,-9.906058,51.64931,68514,-9.9079,51.64691,68366,-9.908508,51.64324,68224,-9.91011,51.63966,68075,-9.912947,51.63619,67925,-9.917405,51.6333,67815,-9.918905,51.63243,67554,-9.919224,51.63149,67324,-9.91896,51.63097,67204,-9.91811,51.63099,67044,-9.917143,51.63143,66755,-9.917111,51.63192,66624,-9.917417,51.63214,66485,-9.917718,51.63239,66215,-9.918417,51.63295,65975,-9.91576,51.63326,65823,-9.910582,51.6392,65665,-9.90801,51.64649,65503,-9.907195,51.65126,64963,-9.907665,51.65178,63633,-9.907873,51.65185,62325,-9.907868,51.65184,61034,-9.907866,51.65181,59655,-9.907888,51.65187,58255,-9.907848,51.65187,56974,-9.907902,51.65188,55585,-9.90799,51.65186,54255,-9.907915,51.65194,52855,-9.9078,51.65184,51545,-9.907878,51.65187,50115,-9.907851,51.6518,48825,-9.907915,51.65185,47474,-9.907907,51.65185,46085,-9.90784,51.65186,44725,-9.907893,51.65189,43404,-9.907853,51.65187,42044,-9.907857,51.65186,40635,-9.90783,51.65186,39295,-9.907784,51.65182,37954,-9.907779,51.65189,36584,-9.907808,51.65188,35314,-9.907851,51.65181,34033,-9.90788,51.65185,32675,-9.907786,51.65184,31294,-9.907898,51.65189,29935,-9.907837,51.65179,28584,-9.907858,51.6518,27285,-9.907884,51.65187,25855,-9.90785,51.65182,24515,-9.907917,51.65181,23115,-9.907957,51.65182,21755,-9.907888,51.65187,20434,-9.907942,51.65187,19024,-9.907875,51.65187,17645,-9.907925,51.65187,16274,-9.90789,51.65187,15015,-9.907845,51.65189,13665,-9.907846,51.65191,12263,-9.907875,51.65185,10875,-9.90792,51.65191,9595,-9.90787,51.65185,8284,-9.90782,51.65189,6985,-9.907851,51.65185,5654,-9.907825,51.65187,4425,-9.90785,51.65181,3064,-9.907864,51.65184,1845,-9.907931,51.65187,503,-9.907833,51.65191]},{"name":"OCEAN CHALLENGER","text":"OCEAN CHALLENGER:An ocean (from Ancient Greek Ὠκεανός, transc. Okeanós, the sea of classical antiquity[1]) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere.[2] On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.[3][4] The word sea is often used interchangeably with \"ocean\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.Saline water covers approximately 72% of the planet's surface (~3.6×108 km2) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's biosphere.[6] The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water, and oceanographers have stated that less than 5% of the World Ocean has been explored.[6] The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters (12,100 ft).As the world ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, it is integral to all known life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns. The world ocean is the habitat of 230,000 known species, but because much of it is unexplored, the number of species that exist is much larger, possibly over two million.[10] The origin of Earth's oceans remains unknown; oceans are thought to have formed in the Hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life.Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds. The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan, although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System. Early in their geologic histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans. The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of Europa is estimated to have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System's giant planets are also thought to have liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions. Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone. Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.Etymology: The word « ocean » comes from the figure in classical antiquity, Oceanus (/oʊˈsiːənəs/; Greek: Ὠκεανός Ōkeanós,[13] pronounced [ɔːkeanós]), the elder of the Titans in classical Greek mythology, believed by the ancient Greeks and Romans to be the divine personification of the sea, an enormous river encircling the world.The concept of Ōkeanós has an Indo-European connection. Greek Ōkeanós has been compared to the Vedic epithet ā-śáyāna-, predicated of the dragon Vṛtra-, who captured the cows/rivers. Related to this notion, the Okeanos is represented with a dragon-tail on some early Greek vases.","path":[82639,-9.904703,51.64953,81380,-9.904715,51.64948,80118,-9.904629,51.64945,78860,-9.90467,51.64949,77598,-9.904714,51.64948,76159,-9.904698,51.64942,74898,-9.904655,51.64945,73639,-9.904775,51.64943,72378,-9.904665,51.64944,71117,-9.904703,51.64948,69859,-9.904715,51.64944,68599,-9.90465,51.64951,67339,-9.904712,51.64948,66078,-9.90468,51.64954,64818,-9.904734,51.64952,63559,-9.904683,51.64945,62297,-9.90467,51.64953,61037,-9.90464,51.64947,59778,-9.90469,51.64944,58517,-9.90463,51.64949,57257,-9.90465,51.64948,55997,-9.904701,51.64944,54737,-9.904555,51.64941,53535,-9.904899,51.64939,53407,-9.905512,51.64931,53198,-9.907905,51.64717,53055,-9.90808,51.64301,52929,-9.90417,51.64122,52795,-9.89631,51.64242,52595,-9.882513,51.64456,52448,-9.872501,51.64614,52308,-9.862944,51.64751,52159,-9.852725,51.6489,52019,-9.842823,51.64919,51859,-9.831587,51.64922,51719,-9.8217,51.64934,51568,-9.811085,51.64975,51429,-9.801332,51.65044,51282,-9.791005,51.65116,51142,-9.781183,51.65172,51005,-9.771519,51.65118,50859,-9.761383,51.64991,50728,-9.752335,51.64875,50599,-9.743207,51.648,50459,-9.733555,51.64888,50252,-9.719711,51.65176,50109,-9.710254,51.65382,49968,-9.700945,51.65593,49828,-9.691677,51.65803,49597,-9.676443,51.66141,49449,-9.6668,51.66351,49299,-9.656959,51.66566,49149,-9.647099,51.66777,49007,-9.637807,51.66977,48857,-9.627974,51.67196,48699,-9.617496,51.67432,48558,-9.608263,51.67639,48348,-9.594497,51.67964,48198,-9.585326,51.68288,48048,-9.576292,51.68627,47895,-9.567139,51.68966,47751,-9.560165,51.69225,47598,-9.555112,51.69428,47449,-9.54959,51.69627,47289,-9.543457,51.69826,47155,-9.538148,51.69961,46955,-9.53148,51.6991,46328,-9.53237,51.69833,45019,-9.532369,51.69865,44899,-9.532515,51.69882,44775,-9.532753,51.69924,44645,-9.533016,51.69938,44531,-9.533465,51.69942,44401,-9.534093,51.6996,44148,-9.534542,51.69971,42751,-9.537465,51.69923,42621,-9.537211,51.69845,42497,-9.536603,51.6979,42225,-9.536433,51.69757,41985,-9.537032,51.69765,41798,-9.540462,51.69481,41648,-9.546257,51.68972,41441,-9.55343,51.68244,41297,-9.555741,51.67673,41161,-9.5549,51.67169,40958,-9.542309,51.67347,40811,-9.534119,51.67615,40598,-9.529252,51.68114,39387,-9.52903,51.68146,38018,-9.529132,51.68122,37778,-9.52985,51.68051,37538,-9.534212,51.67584,37387,-9.541536,51.67263,37236,-9.54958,51.67015,37077,-9.558197,51.66788,36876,-9.569952,51.66628,36736,-9.579449,51.66508,36604,-9.58868,51.66397,36398,-9.603037,51.66241,36248,-9.613537,51.66123,36106,-9.623605,51.66031,35967,-9.633347,51.65937,35821,-9.643643,51.65835,35688,-9.65304,51.6574,35547,-9.66301,51.65641,35404,-9.673175,51.65537,35206,-9.687243,51.65385,35067,-9.697,51.65295,34928,-9.70671,51.65197,34714,-9.72167,51.65033,34577,-9.731189,51.64912,34441,-9.740586,51.64788,34297,-9.750952,51.64777,34156,-9.760674,51.64915,34010,-9.770324,51.65133,33867,-9.780534,51.65123,33727,-9.790588,51.65082,33577,-9.801512,51.65041,33433,-9.811853,51.64978,33277,-9.823125,51.64907,33117,-9.834695,51.64857,32937,-9.847834,51.64812,32737,-9.862365,51.64766,32600,-9.872108,51.64611,32467,-9.881547,51.64459,32327,-9.89129,51.64316,32130,-9.904462,51.64104,32000,-9.90812,51.64401,31867,-9.907845,51.64757,31724,-9.906713,51.64973,31587,-9.90703,51.6502,31448,-9.90751,51.65048,31056,-9.908185,51.6508,29817,-9.90826,51.65077,28558,-9.908288,51.65084,27298,-9.908237,51.6508,26037,-9.90821,51.65081,24777,-9.908198,51.65088,23518,-9.90821,51.65079,22257,-9.908183,51.65083,20997,-9.908281,51.65079,19738,-9.908205,51.65082,18477,-9.908225,51.65087,17218,-9.908274,51.6508,15959,-9.908172,51.65083,14697,-9.908183,51.65083,13438,-9.908247,51.65076,12178,-9.9082,51.65081,10919,-9.908238,51.65075,9659,-9.908235,51.65074,8399,-9.90815,51.65079,7137,-9.90822,51.65078,5877,-9.908228,51.65083,4618,-9.908174,51.65081,3358,-9.908221,51.65081,2099,-9.90821,51.6508,658,-9.908285,51.65081]},{"name":"BRITANNIA V","text":"BRITANNIA V:Britannia was the Greek and Roman term for the geographical region of Great Britain or Great Britain and Ireland which was inhabited by the Britons, Belgae and Picts and is the name given to the female personification of the island. It is a term still used to refer to the island today. The name is Latin, and derives from the Greek form Prettanike or Brettaniai, which originally designated a collection of islands with individual names, including Albion or Great Britain; however, by the 1st century BC, Britannia came to be used for Great Britain specifically. In AD 43 the Roman Empire began its conquest of the island, establishing a province they called Britannia, which came to encompass the parts of the island south of Caledonia (roughly Scotland). In the 2nd century, Roman Britannia came to be personified as a goddess, armed with a trident and shield and wearing a Corinthian helmet. The name Britannia long survived the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 5th century and yielded the name for the island in most European and various other languages, including the English Britain and the modern Welsh Prydain. After centuries of declining use, the Latin form was revived during the English Renaissance as a rhetorical evocation of a British national identity. Especially following the Acts of Union in 1707, which joined the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, the personification of the martial Britannia was used as an emblem of British imperial power and unity. A British cultural icon, she was featured on all modern British coinage series until the redesign in 2008, and still appears annually on the gold and silver \"Britannia\" bullion coin series. In 2015 a new definitive £2 coin was issued, with a new image of Britannia.

As such he is brother-in-law to Isaac and both father-in-law and uncle to Jacob. Laban and his family were described as dwelling in Paddan Aram, in Mesopotamia. Though the biblical text itself does not attest to this, Rabbinic sources also identify him as the father of Bilhah and Zilpah, the two concubines with whom Jacob also has children (Midrash Raba, Gen 24)Laban first appears in the Hebrew Bible in Genesis 24:29–60 as the grown spokesman for his father Bethuel's house; he was impressed by the gold jewelry given to his sister on behalf of Isaac, and played a key part in arranging their marriage. Twenty years later, Laban's nephew Jacob was born to Isaac and Rebekah.When grown, Jacob comes to work for Laban. The Biblical narrative provides a framework for dating these events: Jacob begat Joseph 14 years after his flight to Laban; Joseph entered Pharaoh's service at age 30; and from that point, after seven years of plenty and two years of famine, Jacob met Pharaoh and stated his age as 130. Subtracting yields an age of 77 (Jacob at his flight to Laban). Laban was more than 30 years older than Jacob, and employed him for 20 years.Laban promised his younger daughter Rachel to Jacob in return for seven years' service, only to trick him into marrying his elder daughter Leah instead. Jacob then served another seven years in exchange for the right to marry his choice, Rachel, as well (Genesis 29). Laban's flocks and fortunes increased under Jacob's skilled care, but there was much further trickery between them. Six years after his promised service has ended, Jacob, having prospered largely by proving more cunning than his father-in-law, finally left. Laban pursued him, but they eventually parted on good terms (Genesis 31).Laban can be seen as symbolizing those whose concern for the welfare of their immediate family, nominally a virtue, is taken to the point where it has lasting negative ramifications. Laban's urge to ensure his older daughter not be left unmarried can be interpreted as leading to the Exile in Egypt; his anxiety over seeing his son-in-law throw away his family's comfortable position in Aram in search of a risky new beginning back in Canaan leads him to oppose the return of the Children of Israel to the Promised Land.[1] His name can also be seen as symbolic in this matter: it means \"white\", the visual representation of purity, without visible stain, symbolizing those without apparent evil motives whose actions nevertheless result in undesirable outcomes.Laban is referenced significantly in the Passover Haggadah, in the context of the answer to the traditional child's question, \"Why is this night different from all other nights?\" The prescribed answer begins with a quote from Deuteronomy 26:5: \"arami oved avi\": normally translated as \"a wandering Aramean was my father\", alluding either to Abram or Jacob, but here interpreted unusually as \"ibad arami et-avi\", \"an Aramean destroyed my father\", as made clear by the rabbinical exegesis read in the Seder:There may also be a play on words here, using arami in two senses – as both arami, \"an Aramean\", and rama′i, \"a deceiver\", since Laban cheated Jacob (Genesis Rabbah 70:19). In this interpretation, arami personifies the Israelite peoplesꞌs bitter enemy.[2]The question of what the connection is between the apparently disjoint tales of Laban and Pharaoh is interpreted in several ways by rabbinical authorities.Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer explains in his Hukkat HaPesach that Laban was, in fact, the primum mobile of the entire Exile and Exodus saga. Rachel was Jacob's divinely intended wife and could hypothetically have given birth to Joseph as Jacob's firstborn with rights of primogeniture. In this counterfactual, Jacob's favoring Joseph's succession as the leader of the fledging nation of Israel would have been seen as perfectly normal and fitting, given the customs of the time. No older brothers would have felt cheated and jealous, and Joseph would not have been sold into slavery. Thus, there would have been no need for Jacob's family to be sent to Egypt to unite with Joseph.In actuality, Laban married Jacob to Leah first, causing Leah's sons to precede Joseph in birth order, so that they felt justifiably outraged when their father seemed to violate societal norms by treating his youngest son as his heir, in preference to his older sons' natural and legal rights. In this way, Laban can be seen as \"seeking to uproot all\", by attempting to sever the family tree of the Patriarchs between Jacob and Joseph before the Children of Israel could become more than a single small family.Devora Steinmetz, Assistant Professor of Talmud at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, says that the story of Jacob and Laban also resonates with the covenant with Abraham, more frequently interpreted as applying to the Exodus: \"your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them and they shall afflict them ... Afterward they shall come out with great wealth\" (Genesis 15:13–16). Jacob lived in the strange land of Aram, served Laban, and was afflicted by him; then he left with great wealth and returned to the Promised Land. The story thus serves to reinforce one of the central messages of the Passover Haggadah; that the Old Testament cycle of exile, persecution and return recurs again and again, and links the observant Jew in the Diaspora to the Land of Israel.","path":[33265,-9.858925,51.64316,32977,-9.861667,51.64649,32595,-9.878424,51.64483,32416,-9.890235,51.64349,32257,-9.900772,51.64161,32106,-9.907732,51.64375,31966,-9.907672,51.64813,31775,-9.905922,51.64939,31645,-9.90493,51.64939,31116,-9.904605,51.64936,29846,-9.904634,51.64936,28497,-9.90461,51.64939,27186,-9.90463,51.64937,25907,-9.904618,51.64938,24546,-9.904609,51.64939,23215,-9.904632,51.64936,21906,-9.904616,51.64936,20567,-9.904618,51.64937,19307,-9.90462,51.64937,18027,-9.904613,51.64936,16695,-9.904618,51.64938,15316,-9.904605,51.64937,14066,-9.904602,51.64936,12745,-9.904618,51.64937,11457,-9.904578,51.64937,10196,-9.904609,51.64937,8807,-9.904605,51.64936,7406,-9.9046,51.64936,6106,-9.904616,51.64937,4797,-9.90461,51.64937,3436,-9.904592,51.64936,2095,-9.9046,51.64936,776,-9.904609,51.64938]},{"name":"DILLON OWEN","text":"DILLON OWEN:Dillon is a surname of Irish origin but with Breton-Norman roots. It is first recorded in Ireland with the arrival of Sir Henry de Leon (c.1176 – 1244), of a cadet branch of Viscounty of Léon, Brittany. He arrived in Ireland accompanying Prince John (later King John) of England. The name evolved into the Irish-language \"Diolun\"/English-language \"Dillon\" (not to be confused with the Welsh given name Dylan). It is particularly common in the Meath and Westmeath counties of Ireland where the Dillons were granted vast areas of land. The name is now widespread throughout Ireland. The Dillon family later became the Barons Clonbrock and Earls of Roscommon.","path":[40177,-10.49137,51.5526,39658,-10.45608,51.55208,39498,-10.44533,51.55197,39278,-10.43062,51.55178,38417,-10.37337,51.5511,38218,-10.3602,51.55095,38037,-10.34818,51.55073,37878,-10.33762,51.55052,37718,-10.32705,51.55028,37557,-10.31623,51.55003,37397,-10.30552,51.54984,37238,-10.2949,51.54968,37088,-10.285,51.54953,36938,-10.27507,51.54942,36778,-10.26448,51.54932,36577,-10.25118,51.5493,36057,-10.21678,51.5501,35878,-10.20497,51.5512,35717,-10.19437,51.55217,35498,-10.17993,51.55347,35318,-10.16815,51.55467,34837,-10.13655,51.55785,34597,-10.12088,51.55935,34447,-10.11113,51.56033,34278,-10.10017,51.56143,34128,-10.09047,51.56245,33978,-10.08095,51.56395,33829,-10.0718,51.5661,33688,-10.06318,51.56812,33547,-10.05437,51.5701,33397,-10.04513,51.57221,33247,-10.03593,51.5743,33108,-10.0273,51.57628,32967,-10.01863,51.57827,32828,-10.01008,51.5803,32678,-10.00091,51.58255,32527,-9.99165,51.58488,32387,-9.982984,51.58705,32229,-9.9732,51.58941,32080,-9.964033,51.59167,31938,-9.956183,51.59477,31779,-9.947534,51.5983,31638,-9.939966,51.60158,31504,-9.933583,51.60545,31297,-9.9267,51.61315,30897,-9.917833,51.62903,30748,-9.913415,51.63453,30609,-9.909384,51.64003,30404,-9.9069,51.64865,30057,-9.906281,51.6486,28697,-9.906281,51.64862,27329,-9.90625,51.64863,27209,-9.905882,51.64878,26959,-9.9058,51.64882,25657,-9.9058,51.64882,24339,-9.9058,51.64882,23027,-9.905833,51.6488,21687,-9.905817,51.64882,20348,-9.905817,51.64882,19124,-9.906384,51.6492,18989,-9.908016,51.64648,18857,-9.908517,51.64345,18699,-9.909917,51.63982,18548,-9.9126,51.63603,18408,-9.915033,51.63243,18259,-9.917566,51.62867,18118,-9.920065,51.62505,17959,-9.922983,51.62075,17598,-9.930767,51.61167,17378,-9.935449,51.60629,17228,-9.938666,51.60257,17088,-9.941667,51.5991,16947,-9.944748,51.59563,16808,-9.947667,51.59222,16647,-9.951134,51.5883,16508,-9.954083,51.58488,16359,-9.957334,51.58121,16218,-9.960917,51.5771,16077,-9.965083,51.57235,15918,-9.969767,51.567,15759,-9.974433,51.56161,15608,-9.978867,51.55651,15397,-9.985117,51.54943,15248,-9.9895,51.54443,15097,-9.993865,51.53937,14958,-9.9979,51.53473,14778,-10.00315,51.52873,14557,-10.00953,51.5214,14398,-10.01412,51.51617,14238,-10.01875,51.51088,14087,-10.02305,51.5059,13938,-10.02732,51.50098,13798,-10.03135,51.49638,13648,-10.03565,51.49147,13498,-10.03992,51.48653,13347,-10.0443,51.48155,13197,-10.04863,51.47657,13047,-10.05297,51.47157,12897,-10.05735,51.46657,12748,-10.06167,51.4616,12609,-10.06577,51.45693,12468,-10.06988,51.45221,12308,-10.07455,51.44687,12148,-10.07918,51.44152,12008,-10.08327,51.43685,11857,-10.0876,51.43181,11699,-10.09217,51.42657,11538,-10.09682,51.42125,11378,-10.1014,51.416,11217,-10.10603,51.41068,11058,-10.11058,51.40545,10838,-10.11685,51.39817,10678,-10.12155,51.39283,10528,-10.12593,51.3878,10377,-10.13042,51.38271,10208,-10.13537,51.37697,10057,-10.13983,51.37185,9898,-10.14448,51.36647,9698,-10.15033,51.3597,9518,-10.15563,51.35361,9358,-10.16032,51.34827,9038,-10.1696,51.33757,8337,-10.18985,51.31427]},{"name":"BOY JASON","text":"BOY JASON:David Jason. Sir David John White, OBE (born 2 February 1940), better known by his stage name David Jason, is an English actor and comedian. He played Derek \"Del Boy\" Trotter in the long-running BBC comedy series Only Fools and Horses, and Detective Inspector Jack Frost on the ITV crime drama A Touch of Frost.Other high-profile television roles were as Granville in the sitcom Open All Hours, and Pop Larkin in the comedy drama The Darling Buds of May as well as the voices of Mr. Toad in The Wind in the Willows, Danger Mouse and Count Duckula. His last original appearance as Del Boy was in 2014, while Jason retired his role as Frost in 2010.One of the best loved actors in British popular culture, in September 2006 Jason topped the poll to find TV's 50 Greatest Stars, as part of ITV's 50th anniversary celebrations.[2] He was knighted in 2005 for services to drama. Jason has won four British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs), (1988, 1991, 1997, 2003), four British Comedy Awards (1990, 1992, 1997, 2001) and six National Television Awards (1997, 2001, 2002 twice).Early Life: Jason's father, Arthur R White, was a porter at Billingsgate Fish Market, and his Welsh mother, Olwen Jones, worked as a charwoman. She gave birth to twin boys in Edmonton, London in February 1940, but Jason's twin brother died during childbirth, making him a twinless twin.[1] It is an urban myth that he chose the name Jason as a tribute to his dead twin:[3] David Jason himself has denied this. In 1984, during an interview on TV-am, David Jason admitted that the name David Jason was taken from his like of Jason and the Argonauts, as the stage name David White had already been taken.Jason's elder brother is the actor Arthur White, born in 1933. The two appeared together in the crime drama A Touch of Frost, with Arthur playing police archivist Ernie Trigg; and again in 2008, in the comic fantasy, The Colour of Magic, where Arthur starred as a character called \"Rerpf\". He also appeared briefly with his brother in an episode of The Darling Buds of May. On leaving school, Jason wanted to follow in his brother's footsteps as an actor, but their father insisted that he first get a trade. So, for six years, he trained as an electrician, before giving up his girlfriend at the time, and becoming a jobbing actor. Jason also has a sister, June, seven years his junior.","path":[49919,-10.88583,52.27427,49561,-10.877,52.26125,48869,-10.85917,52.23603,48710,-10.85496,52.23018,48549,-10.85083,52.22428,48359,-10.84594,52.21723,48029,-10.8372,52.20512,47869,-10.83303,52.1992,47639,-10.82713,52.19068,47480,-10.82311,52.18472,47310,-10.81893,52.17837,47170,-10.8154,52.17309,47050,-10.81235,52.16849,46830,-10.80678,52.16014,46590,-10.80075,52.151,46440,-10.79685,52.14541,46249,-10.79196,52.13825,46109,-10.78836,52.13291,45969,-10.78487,52.12764,45811,-10.78086,52.1216,45631,-10.77637,52.11481,45480,-10.77261,52.10918,45389,-10.77039,52.10583,45150,-10.76451,52.09694,42580,-10.68639,52.00516,42391,-10.67865,51.99911,42250,-10.67284,51.99463,42091,-10.66627,51.98958,41950,-10.66023,51.9851,41801,-10.65383,51.98041,41661,-10.64799,51.97594,41420,-10.63782,51.96825,41160,-10.62679,51.95992,40880,-10.61509,51.95093,39930,-10.5756,51.92059,39731,-10.56751,51.91424,39491,-10.5578,51.90651,39359,-10.55245,51.90231,39191,-10.54547,51.89685,39059,-10.54009,51.89262,38580,-10.52041,51.87722,38390,-10.51241,51.87121,38061,-10.49861,51.86075,37880,-10.49101,51.85499,37719,-10.48459,51.84958,37561,-10.47896,51.84383,37400,-10.47331,51.83811,37261,-10.46842,51.83308,37110,-10.4631,51.8278,36971,-10.45824,51.82282,36821,-10.45311,51.81755,36670,-10.44802,51.81225,36540,-10.44353,51.80767,36400,-10.43914,51.80264,36241,-10.43453,51.79676,35859,-10.42314,51.78247,35709,-10.41853,51.77699,35490,-10.41174,51.76897,35330,-10.40676,51.76321,35180,-10.40193,51.75775,35041,-10.39751,51.7527,34921,-10.39396,51.74822,34711,-10.38746,51.74055,34579,-10.38328,51.7358,34410,-10.37784,51.72961,34251,-10.37274,51.72373,34091,-10.36771,51.71786,33940,-10.36299,51.71234,33790,-10.35832,51.70693,33639,-10.35295,51.70161,33491,-10.34838,51.69621,33331,-10.34362,51.69036,33190,-10.33939,51.68528,33040,-10.33488,51.67985,32901,-10.33064,51.67477,32741,-10.32577,51.669,32580,-10.32085,51.66328,32429,-10.31622,51.65787,32290,-10.31193,51.65284,32129,-10.30695,51.64711,31989,-10.30255,51.64207,31770,-10.29549,51.63414,31630,-10.29091,51.62906,31471,-10.28564,51.62342,31310,-10.28041,51.61785,31169,-10.27578,51.61285,31029,-10.27131,51.60782,30870,-10.26602,51.60227,30721,-10.261,51.59701,30581,-10.25634,51.59195,30074,-10.23997,51.57439,29940,-10.23216,51.57263,29789,-10.22247,51.57215,29631,-10.21223,51.57222,29480,-10.2026,51.57213,29250,-10.18756,51.57181,29110,-10.17839,51.5717,28961,-10.1686,51.5716,28819,-10.15949,51.57158,28664,-10.14878,51.57177,28501,-10.13926,51.5729,28360,-10.13032,51.5739,28210,-10.12074,51.5751,27971,-10.10524,51.57689,27811,-10.09496,51.57809,27660,-10.08524,51.57919,27520,-10.07635,51.58009,27371,-10.06686,51.58107,27221,-10.05711,51.58209,27080,-10.04784,51.58314,26950,-10.03948,51.58405,26739,-10.02612,51.5857,26599,-10.01775,51.58775,26371,-10.00434,51.5915,26230,-9.996017,51.59381,26090,-9.987595,51.59611,25941,-9.97879,51.59857,25800,-9.970484,51.60093,25659,-9.962203,51.60323,25511,-9.953386,51.60563,25369,-9.945,51.60798,25220,-9.935985,51.61043,25080,-9.92899,51.61384,24749,-9.919848,51.62552,24601,-9.91611,51.63079,24459,-9.912382,51.63589,24311,-9.908915,51.64144,24173,-9.908069,51.64645,23970,-9.906257,51.64863,22620,-9.906259,51.64861,21310,-9.906261,51.6486,21180,-9.906183,51.64911,21060,-9.907244,51.6506,20820,-9.908095,51.65107,19531,-9.908038,51.65105,18220,-9.908049,51.65107,16919,-9.908067,51.65105,15531,-9.908045,51.65105,14171,-9.908029,51.65106,12910,-9.908067,51.65111,11629,-9.907989,51.65104,10301,-9.907973,51.65105,8999,-9.908103,51.65102,7730,-9.908047,51.65108,6370,-9.908116,51.65099,5010,-9.907965,51.65114,3729,-9.908069,51.65105,2320,-9.908015,51.65107,1020,-9.908085,51.65104]},{"name":"TWISTER","text":"TWISTER:Twister may refer to:Twister may also refer to:A tornado.

She replaced Stena Nordica on the route in March 2015. The ferry was refurbished in Gdańsk, Poland for her new service and was returned to her original design before her SeaFrance career and looks identical to her sisters Stena Superfast VII & VIII. Before November 2014 she operated between Dover and Calais for DFDS Seaways France and between 2008 and 2012 for SeaFrance.Concept and construction.The Superfast X was the last ship in a series of four identical ice classed fast ferries built by HDW for Superfast Ferries' new Baltic Sea services. She was launched on 18 November 2000, on the same date as her sisters Superfast VII[7] and Superfast IXThe Superfast X was delivered to her owners on 26 February 2002 and christened on the same date by Patricia Lederer, wife of the HDW project director for the Superfast ships.Service history. The Superfast X entered service for Superfast Ferries on 27 February 2002 on the Hanko–Rostock route. She remained on that route until 19 April 2002, when she was laid up in Kiel at HDW. On 17 May 2002, she re-entered service, on the Rosyth–Zeebrugge route. In January and February 2004, the Superfast X was rebuilt at Fosen Mekaniske Verksted, Fosen, Norway with additional passenger berths.[2] On 7 August 2006, Superfast Ferries announced it had sold the Superfast X to Veolia Transport for Euro 112 million.[10] The ship was delivered to her new owners on 12 February 2007 and renamed Jean Nicoli.In March 2007, the Jean Nicoli made crossings from Le Havre to Marseille,[citation needed] carrying cars on board. During April the same year, she was chartered to COTUNAV for traffic from Italy and France to Tunisia. At the end of April she was laid up, initially at La Seyne, later at Marseille. From 8 September until 2 October 2007 she was chartered to ANEK Lines for service on its Patras–Corfu–Igoumenitsa–Venice route.[2] On 27 December 2007, the ship was sold to SeaFrance.In the beginning of April 2008, the Jean Nicoli was delivered to SeaFrance and renamed SeaFrance Molière. On 3 April 2008, she left Marseille for Arno Dunkerque for rebuilding into a short distance ferry.[2][5][11] After transfer to the leasing company Sarl Poquelin Bail, she entered service with SeaFrance in freight only operation on 19 August 2008 and began passenger service on 1 September 2008.From 16 November 2011, she was laid up, initially at Dunkerque, due to the commercial court ordering that Seafrance be liquidated, and, following its sale, at Tilbury in England.In October 2012, DFDS chartered the ship to be used on its Dover–Dunkerque crossing.[13] During a short refit by Arno at Dunkerque she was renamed Dieppe Seaways and returned to the French registry. She re-entered service on 7 November though, following a change of plan, on the Dover-Calais route.On 1 May 2014, the Dieppe Seaways suffered a fire from an overheated boiler in the engine room as she approached Dover from Calais. All 316 passengers disembarked safely on arrival. However, in responding to the fire, seven crew members and three firefighters were injured with flash burns.At the end of her charter to DFDS Seaways in November 2014, Stena Line took possession of the vessel returning her to her original name, albeit with a Stena prefix, and sending her for an extensive refit to return the cargo arrangements to their original configuration and refurbish the interiors similar to sisterships MS Stena Superfast VII and MS Stena Superfast VIII operating on the Cairnryan (Loch Ryan) to Belfast route.[1] After refit the ship replaced MS Stena Nordica (which

(uppercase Ε, lowercase ε or lunate ϵ; Greek: Έψιλον) is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, corresponding phonetically to a mid front unrounded vowel /e/. In the system of Greek numerals it has the value five. It was derived from the Phoenician letter He . Letters that arose from epsilon include the Roman E, Ë and Ɛ, and Cyrillic Е, È, Ё, Є and Э.The name of the letter was originally εἶ (Ancient Greek: [êː]), but the name was changed to ἒ ψιλόν (e psilon \"simple e\") in the Middle Ages to distinguish the letter from the digraph αι, a former diphthong that had come to be pronounced the same as epsilon.In essence, the uppercase form of epsilon looks identical to Latin E. The lowercase version has two typographical variants, both inherited from medieval Greek handwriting. One, the most common in modern typography and inherited from medieval minuscule, looks like a reversed \"3\". The other, also known as lunate or uncial epsilon and inherited from earlier uncial writing,[1][2] looks like a semicircle crossed by a horizontal bar. While in normal typography these are just alternative font variants, they may have different meanings as mathematical symbols. Computer systems therefore offer distinct encodings for them.[1] In Unicode, the character U+0一3F5 \"Greek lunate epsilon symbol\" (ϵ) is provided specifically for the lunate form. In TeX, \\epsilon (                        ϵ                          {\\displaystyle \\epsilon \\!}    ) denotes the lunate form, while \\varepsilon (                        ε                          {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon \\!}    ) denotes the reversed-3 form.There is also a Latin epsilon or \"open e\", which looks similar to the Greek lowercase epsilon. It is encoded in Unicode as U+025B (\"Latin small-letter open e\", ɛ) and U+0190 (\"Latin capital-letter open e\", Ɛ) and is used as an IPA phonetic symbol. The lunate or uncial epsilon has also provided inspiration for the euro sign (€).The lunate epsilon (ϵ) is not to be confused with the set membership symbol (∈); nor should the Latin uppercase epsilon (Ɛ) be confused with the Greek uppercase sigma (Σ). The symbol                         ∈                 {\\displaystyle \\in }    , first used in set theory and logic by Giuseppe Peano and now used in mathematics in general for set membership (\"belongs to\") , did, however, evolve from the letter epsilon, since the symbol was originally used as an abbreviation for the Latin word \"est\". In addition, mathematicians have read the symbol                         ∈                 {\\displaystyle \\in }     as \"element of\", as in \"1 is an element of the natural numbers\" for                         1         ∈                    N                          {\\displaystyle 1\\in \\mathbb {N} }    , for example. As late as 1960,                         ϵ                 {\\displaystyle \\epsilon }     itself was used for set membership, while its negation \"does not belong to\" (now                         ∉                 {\\displaystyle \\notin }    ) was denoted by                                    ϵ           ′                          {\\displaystyle \\epsilon '}     (epsilon prime).[3] Only gradually did a fully separate stylized symbol take the place of epsilon. In a related context, Peano also introduced the use of a backwards epsilon,                         ∍                 {\\displaystyle \\backepsilon }    , for the phrase \"such that\", although the abbreviation \"s.t.\" has gradually supplanted                         ∍                 {\\displaystyle \\backepsilon }     in general usage.The letter Ε was taken over from the Phoenician letter He () when Greeks first adopted alphabetic writing. In archaic Greek writing, its shape is often still identical to that of the Phoenician letter. Like other Greek letters, it could face either leftward or rightward (), depending on the current writing direction, but, just like in Phoenician, the horizontal bars always faced in the direction of writing. Archaic writing often preserves the Phoenician form with a vertical stem extending slightly below the lowest horizontal bar. In the classical era, through the influence of more cursive writing styles, the shape was simplified to the current E glyph.[4]While the original pronunciation of the Phoenician letter He was [h], the earliest Greek sound value of Ε was determined by the vowel occurring in the Phoenician letter name, which made it a natural choice for being reinterpreted from a consonant symbol to a vowel symbol denoting an [e] sound.[5] Besides its classical Greek sound value, the short /e/ phoneme, it could initially also be used for other [e]-like sounds. For instance, in early Attic before c.500 B.C., it was used also both for the long, open /ɛː/, and for the long close /eː/. In the former role, it was later replaced in the classic Greek alphabet by Eta (Η), which was taken over from eastern Ionic alphabets, while in the latter role it was replaced by the digraph spelling ΕΙ.Some dialects used yet other ways of distinguishing between various e-like sounds.In Corinth, the normal function of Ε to denote /e/ and /ɛː/ was taken by a glyph resembling a pointed B (), while Ε was used only for long close /eː/.[6] The letter Beta, in turn, took the deviant shape .In Sicyon, a variant glyph resembling an X () was used in the same function as Corinthian .[7]In Thespiai (Boeotia), a special letter form consisting of a vertical stem with a single rightward-pointing horizontal bar () was used for what was probably a raised variant of /e/ in pre-vocalic environments.[8][9] This tack glyph was used elsewhere also as a form of \"Heta\", i.e. for the sound /h/.After the establishment of the canonical classic Greek alphabet[clarify], new glyph variants for Ε were introduced through handwriting. In the uncial script (used for literary papyrus manuscripts in late antiquity and then in early medieval vellum codices), the \"lunate\" shape () became predominant. In cursive handwriting, a large number of shorthand glyphs came to be used, where the cross-bar and the curved stroke were linked in various ways.[10] Some of them resembled a modern lowercase Latin \"e\", some a \"6\" with a connecting stroke to the next letter starting from the middle, and some a combination of two small \"c\"-like curves. Several of these shapes were later taken over into minuscule book hand. Of the various minuscule letter shapes, the inverted-3 form became the basis for lower-case Epsilon in Greek typography during the modern era.Despite its pronunciation as mid, in the International Phonetic Alphabet, the Latin epsilon /ɛ/ represents open-mid front unrounded vowel, as in the English word \"pet\" /ˈpɛt/.The uppercase Epsilon is not commonly used outside of the Greek language because of its similarity to the Latin letter E.The Greek lowercase epsilon ε, the lunate epsilon symbol ϵ, or the Latin lowercase epsilon ɛ (see above) is used as the symbol for:These characters are used only as mathematical symbols.

Recorded in east London's Miloco Studios with producers James Ford and Mike Crossey, the album was preceded by the release of \"Brianstorm\" on 16 April 2007.Change of style[edit] In comparison to the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, the album has been described as \"very, very fast and very, very loud,\"[7] being seen as \"more ambitious, heavier...and with a fiercely bright production\". Reflecting the band's travels around the world more than local stories of the first record, FWN is a \"faster, meaner\" album.[9] The album arguably has influences from The Smiths - \"twanging, quasi-ambient backdrops...and Turner's voice [...] crooning like Morrissey or Richard Hawley.\"[8] Matt Helders said \"James was DJing loads in the evening so we'd go out and . . . have a dance.\" As a result, the drum rhythms of Helders and bassist Nick O'Malley have drawn comparisons to the Eighties funk band ESG.The band's love of classic films also influences their new style. For example, the organ at the beginning of the album's final track, \"505\" is taken directly from Ennio Morricone's soundtrack for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (where Angel Eyes enters before the final standoff).History of the album. The album title, \"Favourite Worst Nightmare\", came from the song \"D is for Dangerous\", the third song featured on the album. The band said they also considered naming the album Lesbian Wednesdays, Gordon Brown or Gary Barlow\". In an interview with NME, Nick O'Malley announced several titles including \"D is for Dangerous\" and \"Balaclava\". The tracks \"The Bakery\" and \"Plastic Tramp\" also mentioned in the NME interview did not make it onto the album, but were later released as B-sides on the \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" single. The track \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\" was also rumoured for inclusion, though it didn't make it. 6 of the 12 songs were debuted at gigs before they released the album. The album was recorded quickly as the band wanted to get out and play the songs again.Critical reception: Favourite Worst Nightmare has received universal acclaim since release, with a score of 82 on Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews.[11] In a 5-star review, The Daily Express described it as \"a shockingly good release that just gets better, faster and stronger with each listen\",while The Guardian said it had \"successfully negotiated the daunting task of following up the biggest-selling debut album in British history\" and stated that the second half of the album was the stronger half, noting the similarity to Morrissey in \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" whilst criticising the opening tracks, Brianstorm in particular. Their progression was also highlighted with The Guardian saying \"if you removed everything from the album except Matt Helders' drumming, it would still be a pretty gripping listen\",and The Observer praising the new sounds on the album referencing the \"piercing, melodic guitar by Jamie Cook\" and \"where Turner reveals the other weapons in his armoury\" when referring to Alex Turner's progression.Pitchfork Media noticed the \"new emotional depth\" of tracks such as \"Do Me a Favour\", \"Only Ones Who Know\" and \"505\",which were also commonly cited by most other critics as being

page \"NORBANK\" does not exist. Norbana (gens)The gens Norbana was a plebeian family at Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned toward the beginning of the first century BC, and from then to the end of the second century AD they filled a number of magistracies and other important posts, first in the late Republic, and subsequently under the emperors.Origin: Because the great majority of Roman gentilicia end in -ius, many writers have supposed Norbanus to have been a cognomen, perhaps belonging to a branch of the Junia gens. In fact, it is itself a nomen gentilicium, belonging to a class of nomina derived from place-names, and ending in -anus.[1][2] Such names were common in families of Umbrian origin, although less characteristic of Latin gentes.[3] In the case of the Norbani, the name is derived from the town of Norba, in Latium.Branches and cognomina.

is the Latin name for Odysseus, a hero in ancient Greek literature.Ulysses may also refer to a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920, and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday. It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature,[1] and has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement\".[2] According to Declan Kiberd, \"Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking.\"[3]\n\nUlysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904.[4][5] Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early twentieth century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland's relationship to Britain. The novel imitates registers of centuries of English literature and is highly allusive.\n\nUlysses is approximately 265,000 words in length[6] and is divided into eighteen episodes. Since publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from early obscenity trials to protracted textual \"Joyce Wars\". Ulysses' stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose — full of puns, parodies, and allusions — as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour, have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works ever written. Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday.Joyce first encountered the figure of Odysseus/Ulysses in Charles Lamb's Adventures of Ulysses—an adaptation of the Odyssey for children, which seemed to establish the Roman name in Joyce's mind. At school he wrote an essay on the character, entitled \"My Favourite Hero\".[7][8] Joyce told Frank Budgen that he considered Ulysses the only all-round character in literature.[9] He thought about calling his short-story collection Dubliners by the name Ulysses in Dublin,[10] but the idea grew from a story in Dubliners in 1906, to a \"short book\" in 1907,[11] to the vast novel that he began in 1914.Joyce divided Ulysses into 18 episodes. At first glance much of the book may appear unstructured and chaotic; Joyce once said that he had \"put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant\", which would earn the novel immortality.[17] The two schemata which Stuart Gilbert and Herbert Gorman released after publication to defend Joyce from the obscenity accusations made the links to the Odyssey clear, and also explained the work's internal structure.\nEvery episode of Ulysses has a theme, technique and correspondence between its characters and those of the Odyssey. The original text did not include these episode titles and the correspondences; instead, they originate from the Linati and Gilbert schemata. Joyce referred to the episodes by their Homeric titles in his letters.

PILOT","text":"LIFFEY PILOT:The Liffey Swim, currently titled the Dublin City Liffey Swim, is an annual race in Dublin's main river, the Liffey, and is one of Ireland's most famous traditional sporting events. The race is managed by a voluntary not-for-profit organisation, Leinster Open Sea. The 97th Liffey Swim took place on Saturday 6 August 2016, starting at the Rory O’Moore Bridge (Watling Street Bridge) beside the Guinness Brewery.The race is one of the last swims in a season of 30 open sea races held during the summer months, organised by Leinster Open Sea, and takes place usually on a Saturday in either late August or early September. Entrants to the Liffey Swim must complete six qualifying open sea races from the annual Leinster Open Sea Calendar (up from four pre-2015). Many levels and ages of swimmers compete in the race, but entrants must be a member of a swimming club. International competitors are common. The race is handicapped with the slowest swimmers starting first and the fastest last. In 2016 267 men and 147 women took part in the 97th Liffey Swim. For five years between 1934 and 1938, the Liffey Swim was run as a scratch race.Course:The race starts at Rory O'More Bridge near the Guinness Brewery and takes competitors past landmarks such as the Four Courts. The competitors swim under James Joyce Bridge, Mellows Bridge, Father Mathew Bridge, O'Donovan Rossa Bridge, Grattan Bridge, Millenium Bridge, Liffey Bridge, O'Connell Bridge, Rosie Hackett Bridge, Butt Bridge and Loopline Bridge near The Custom House.[2] Average entry is 200 males and 80 females. Wetsuits are not allowed. The race is held in the tidal section of the river meaning it is flushed twice daily. Due to the tidal nature of the Liffey, race times vary from year to year.For four years 1936—1939, the Liffey Swim took place from Bull Wall to Dollymount Strand (in 1939 to Clontarf Baths) because of the degree of pollution of the course stretch of the River Liffey.[1] For the three years 1977—1979, again because of the risks to health caused by pollution, the race was moved to an upstream stretch of the river near Chapelizod, finishing at the slipway of Dublin University Boat House, at Memorial Park, Islandbridge.Due to the development of the LUAS Bridge, the Rosie Hackett Bridge, from Hawkins Street to Malborough Street, the race diverged from the historic route in 2012 and 2013 starting at the Loopline Bridge beside Butt Bridge and finishing at the pontoon on the North side of the river beside the East Link Bridge in front of the 3Arena. At approx. 1,600 metres it was somewhat shorter than the more spectator friendly route down the Liffey and under its numerous bridges.","path":[72201,-6.150687,53.34403,71934,-6.103398,53.34586,65140,-6.20352,53.34462,64901,-6.21163,53.34501,64391,-6.215425,53.3476,64213,-6.21524,53.34777,58783,-6.168947,53.34387,58482,-6.125463,53.33364,55420,-6.204134,53.34652,54878,-6.204342,53.34575,54430,-6.204134,53.34642,54131,-6.176538,53.34375,53770,-6.119923,53.33724,53590,-6.092647,53.33055,52271,-6.144597,53.34361,51673,-6.187531,53.34436,51492,-6.196207,53.34439,48143,-6.204088,53.34695,44478,-6.204095,53.34519,44088,-6.159562,53.34339,41960,-6.126382,53.33276,30579,-6.208628,53.3448,28386,-6.198431,53.34377,28176,-6.16671,53.34397,27816,-6.11508,53.34251,26977,-6.175238,53.34389,23861,-6.188235,53.344,23561,-6.142977,53.34301,23322,-6.106493,53.34089,21462,-6.203495,53.34455,16677,-6.203863,53.34341,8306,-6.195985,53.34374,8125,-6.168503,53.34387,8005,-6.149865,53.34354,7764,-6.112813,53.34168]},{"name":"STENA ADVENTURER","text":"STENA ADVENTURER:Stena Adventurer is a large roll on/roll off passenger (ro-pax) ferry operated by Stena Line on its Holyhead - Dublin route.

KELT (FM), call letters of a FM radio station located in Encinal, Texas. KELT, the former call letters of a FM radio station located in Adelanto, California. Kelt is the name of a beer found in Slovakia and the Czech Republic.\nThe NATO Reporting Name (AS-5 Kelt) for the Raduga KSR-2 cruise missile formerly used by the armed forces of the Soviet Union. The acronym for Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope, an astronomical survey for transiting exoplanets, or the planets discovered by the KELT survey, such as KELT-2Ab is an extrasolar planet that orbits the star KELT-2A approximately 419 light-years away in the constellation of Auriga.[1] It was discovered by the KELT-North survey via the transit method, so both its mass and radius are known quite precisely. As of its discovery KELT-2Ab is the fifth-brightest transiting Hot Jupiter known that has a well constrained mass. This makes the KELT-2A system a promising target for future space- and ground-based follow-up observations to learn about the planet's atmosphere. The star KELT-2A is a member of the common-proper-motion binary star system KELT-2 (HD 42176). KELT-2B is an early K dwarf approximately 295 astronomical units away.","path":[82641,-5.655965,53.90888,82492,-5.659905,53.90236,82302,-5.664883,53.89412,82152,-5.668847,53.88758,82022,-5.672245,53.88194,81892,-5.675628,53.87631,81742,-5.679542,53.86982,81591,-5.683438,53.86329,81401,-5.688357,53.85505,81211,-5.693222,53.84685,81052,-5.697237,53.83999,80852,-5.702233,53.83136,80710,-5.70584,53.82523,80562,-5.709577,53.81886,80371,-5.714415,53.81063,80231,-5.717938,53.80459,80100,-5.72116,53.79892,79892,-5.726427,53.78996,79752,-5.729962,53.78396,79622,-5.733272,53.77841,79491,-5.736543,53.77283,79290,-5.741601,53.76429,79161,-5.744855,53.75883,79022,-5.748325,53.75293,78812,-5.753553,53.74402,78662,-5.757262,53.73767,78541,-5.76028,53.73253,78392,-5.764025,53.72623,78241,-5.767765,53.71983,78041,-5.77271,53.71137,77902,-5.776205,53.70546,77742,-5.780142,53.69869,77592,-5.783812,53.69235,77451,-5.787288,53.68639,77252,-5.792193,53.67801,77112,-5.795565,53.67208,76962,-5.799155,53.66573,76822,-5.802518,53.65981,76671,-5.806127,53.65349,76482,-5.810665,53.64555,76342,-5.814057,53.63966,76202,-5.817512,53.63379,76082,-5.820475,53.62878,75872,-5.82556,53.62002,75731,-5.82905,53.61419,75591,-5.832535,53.60839,75442,-5.836222,53.60217,75301,-5.839645,53.59637,75152,-5.843325,53.59019,75011,-5.846895,53.5844,74862,-5.85111,53.57836,74721,-5.85536,53.57271,74581,-5.859571,53.56711,74431,-5.864188,53.56113,74292,-5.868413,53.55561,74161,-5.872358,53.55043,74001,-5.877148,53.54411,73862,-5.881283,53.53861,73651,-5.887708,53.53026,73491,-5.892539,53.52393,73310,-5.897974,53.5167,73162,-5.902431,53.51079,73022,-5.906611,53.50512,72892,-5.910215,53.49989,72701,-5.915445,53.49221,72520,-5.920367,53.48495,72332,-5.925375,53.4774,72192,-5.92902,53.47189,72051,-5.9327,53.46633,71901,-5.936572,53.4604,71772,-5.939858,53.4553,71641,-5.943121,53.45012,71430,-5.948322,53.44176,71290,-5.951869,53.43624,71132,-5.955915,53.43,70992,-5.95936,53.42443,70852,-5.962821,53.41889,70661,-5.967632,53.41129,70511,-5.97149,53.40531,70362,-5.975368,53.39942,70172,-5.980613,53.39198,70032,-5.984775,53.38601,69872,-5.98985,53.37881,69742,-5.993989,53.37295,69622,-5.99773,53.36767,69442,-6.003127,53.35979,69321,-6.006603,53.35453,69182,-6.01049,53.34847,69050,-6.017793,53.34469,68891,-6.02998,53.34192,68752,-6.040365,53.33939,68591,-6.052492,53.33647,68451,-6.062968,53.33383,68301,-6.073925,53.33085,68171,-6.083955,53.33109,68012,-6.095722,53.33523,67882,-6.105445,53.3385,67741,-6.11635,53.34112,67621,-6.126137,53.34163,67472,-6.138205,53.34246,67331,-6.148859,53.34333,67182,-6.159787,53.34373,66990,-6.171617,53.34358,66841,-6.179147,53.34349,66701,-6.186198,53.34339,66531,-6.194785,53.34354,66371,-6.203222,53.34385,66211,-6.211077,53.3444,66042,-6.213405,53.34602,65231,-6.213227,53.34613,64016,-6.213198,53.34613,62036,-6.213247,53.3461,60056,-6.213252,53.34611,58076,-6.213223,53.34611,56096,-6.213192,53.34607,54296,-6.213213,53.34609,52496,-6.213207,53.3461,50516,-6.21323,53.34609,48716,-6.213225,53.34611,46736,-6.213217,53.34609,44396,-6.213245,53.3461,42775,-6.213217,53.34612,40796,-6.213253,53.34609,38635,-6.21323,53.3461,37375,-6.213228,53.34611,36115,-6.213264,53.34609,34855,-6.213237,53.34611,32875,-6.213213,53.34611,31076,-6.213232,53.34612,29815,-6.213275,53.3461,28556,-6.213243,53.34614,27115,-6.21324,53.34613,25135,-6.213213,53.3461,23875,-6.213242,53.34607,22616,-6.21322,53.34613,21355,-6.213248,53.34612,19735,-6.213247,53.34612,18475,-6.213278,53.34612,16855,-6.213228,53.34612,15595,-6.213232,53.34613,14335,-6.213228,53.34609,13075,-6.213255,53.3461,11815,-6.213225,53.34614,10555,-6.213217,53.34613,9295,-6.213228,53.34612,8035,-6.213255,53.34613,6775,-6.213247,53.3461,5515,-6.213247,53.34611,4255,-6.213242,53.34612,2995,-6.213212,53.34611,1734,-6.2132,53.34612,474,-6.21324,53.34612]},{"name":"JONATHAN SWIFT","text":"JONATHAN SWIFT:Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745) was an Anglo-Irish[1] satirist, essayist, political pamphleteer (first for the Whigs, then for the Tories), poet and cleric who became Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.[2]Swift is remembered for works such as A Tale of a Tub (1704), An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity (1712), Gulliver's Travels (1726), and A Modest Proposal (1729). He is regarded by the Encyclopædia Britannica as the foremost prose satirist in the English language,[1] and is less well known for his poetry. He originally published all of his works under pseudonyms – such as Lemuel Gulliver, Isaac Bickerstaff, Drapier's Letters as MB Drapier – or anonymously. He is also known for being a master of two styles of satire, the Horatian and Juvenalian styles.His deadpan, ironic writing style, particularly in A Modest Proposal, has led to such satire being subsequently termed \"Swiftian\".[3]Jonathan Swift was born on 30 November 1667 in Dublin, Ireland. He was the second child and only son of Jonathan Swift (1640–1667) and his wife Abigail Erick (or Herrick) of Frisby on the Wreake.[4] His father was a native of Goodrich, Herefordshire, but he accompanied his brothers to Ireland to seek their fortunes in law after their Royalist father's estate was brought to ruin during the English Civil War. Swift's father died in Dublin about seven months before he was born.[5][6] His mother returned to England after his birth, leaving him in the care of his influential uncle Godwin, a close friend and confidant of Sir John Temple whose son later employed Swift as his secretary.[7]Swift's family had several interesting literary connections. His grandmother Elizabeth (Dryden) Swift was the niece of Sir Erasmus Dryden, grandfather of poet John Dryden. The same grandmother's aunt Katherine (Throckmorton) Dryden was a first cousin of Elizabeth, wife of Sir Walter Raleigh. His great-great grandmother Margaret (Godwin) Swift was the sister of Francis Godwin, author of The Man in the Moone which influenced parts of Swift's Gulliver's Travels. His uncle Thomas Swift married a daughter of poet and playwright Sir William Davenant, a godson of William Shakespeare.Swift's benefactor and uncle Godwin Swift (1628–1695) took primary responsibility for the young man, sending him with one of his cousins to Kilkenny College (also attended by philosopher George Berkeley).[7] He attended Dublin University (Trinity College, Dublin) in 1682, financed by Godwin's son Willoughby, from which he received his B.A. in 1686 and developed his friendship with William Congreve. Swift was studying for his master's degree when political troubles in Ireland surrounding the Glorious Revolution forced him to leave for England in 1688, where his mother helped him get a position as secretary and personal assistant of Sir William Temple at Moor Park, Farnham.[8] Temple was an English diplomat who arranged the Triple Alliance of 1668. He had retired from public service to his country estate to tend his gardens and write his memoirs. Gaining his employer's confidence, Swift \"was often trusted with matters of great importance\".[9] Within three years of their acquaintance, Temple had introduced his secretary to William III and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments.Swift took up his residence at Moor Park where he met Esther Johnson, then eight years old, the daughter of an impoverished widow who acted as companion to Temple's sister Lady Giffard. Swift was her tutor and mentor, giving her the nickname \"Stella\", and the two maintained a close but ambiguous relationship for the rest of Esther's life.[10]In 1690, Swift left Temple for Ireland because of his health but returned to Moor Park the following year. The illness consisted of fits of vertigo or giddiness, now known to be Ménière's disease, and it continued to plague him throughout his life. During this second stay with Temple, Swift received his M.A. from Hart Hall, Oxford in 1692. Then he left Moor Park, apparently despairing of gaining a better position through Temple's patronage, to become an ordained priest in the Established Church of Ireland. He was appointed to the prebend of Kilroot in the Diocese of Connor in 1694, with his parish located at Kilroot, near Carrickfergus in County Antrim.Swift appears to have been miserable in his new position, being isolated in a small, remote community far from the centres of power and influence. While at Kilroot, however, he may well have become romantically involved with Jane Waring, whom he called \"Varina\", the sister of an old college friend.[9] A letter from him survives, offering to remain if she would marry him and promising to leave and never return to Ireland if she refused. She presumably refused, because Swift left his post and returned to England and Temple's service at Moor Park in 1696, and he remained there until Temple's death. There he was employed in helping to prepare Temple's memoirs and correspondence for publication. During this time, Swift wrote The Battle of the Books, a satire responding to critics of Temple's Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning (1690), though Battle was not published until 1704.Temple died on 27 January 1699.[9] Swift, normally a harsh judge of human nature, said that all that was good and amiable in mankind had died with Temple.[9] He stayed on briefly in England to complete editing Temple's memoirs, and perhaps in the hope that recognition of his work might earn him a suitable position in England. Unfortunately, his work made enemies among some of Temple's family and friends, in particular Temple's formidable sister Lady Giffard, who objected to indiscretions included in the memoirs.[10] Swift's next move was to approach King William directly, based on his imagined connection through Temple and a belief that he had been promised a position. This failed so miserably that he accepted the lesser post of secretary and chaplain to the Earl of Berkeley, one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. However, when he reached Ireland, he found that the secretaryship had already been given to another. He soon obtained the living of Laracor, Agher, and Rathbeggan, and the prebend of Dunlavin in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.[11]Swift ministered to a congregation of about 15 at Laracor, which was just over four and half miles (7.5 km) from Summerhill, County Meath and twenty miles (32 km) from Dublin. He had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden, making a canal after the Dutch fashion of Moor Park, planting willows, and rebuilding the vicarage. As chaplain to Lord Berkeley, he spent much of his time in Dublin and travelled to London frequently over the next ten years. In 1701, he anonymously published the political pamphlet A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome.Swift had residence in Trim, County Meath after 1700. He wrote many of his works during this time period. In February 1702, Swift received his Doctor of Divinity degree from Trinity College, Dublin. That spring he travelled to England and then returned to Ireland in October, accompanied by Esther Johnson—now 20—and his friend Rebecca Dingley, another member of William Temple's household. There is a great mystery and controversy over Swift's relationship with Esther Johnson, nicknamed \"Stella\". Many, notably his close friend Thomas Sheridan, believed that they were secretly married in 1716; others, like Swift's housekeeper Mrs Brent and Rebecca Dingley (who lived with Stella all through her years in Ireland) dismissed the story as absurd.[12] Swift certainly did not wish her to marry anyone else: in 1704, when their mutual friend William Tisdall informed Swift that he intended to propose to Stella, Swift wrote to him to dissuade him from the idea. Although the tone of the letter was courteous, Swift privately expressed his disgust for Tisdall as an \"interloper\", and they were estranged for many years.During his visits to England in these years, Swift published A Tale of a Tub and The Battle of the Books (1704) and began to gain a reputation as a writer. This led to close, lifelong friendships with Alexander Pope, John Gay, and John Arbuthnot, forming the core of the Martinus Scriblerus Club (founded in 1713).Swift became increasingly active politically in these years.[13] From 1707 to 1709 and again in 1710, Swift was in London unsuccessfully urging upon the Whig administration of Lord Godolphin the claims of the Irish clergy to the First-Fruits and Twentieths (\"Queen Anne's Bounty\"), which brought in about £2,500 a year, already granted to their brethren in England. He found the opposition Tory leadership more sympathetic to his cause, and, when they came to power in 1710, he was recruited to support their cause as editor of The Examiner. In 1711, Swift published the political pamphlet The Conduct of the Allies, attacking the Whig government for its inability to end the prolonged war with France. The incoming Tory government conducted secret (and illegal) negotiations with France, resulting in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) ending the War of the Spanish Succession.Swift was part of the inner circle of the Tory government,[14] and often acted as mediator between Henry St John (Viscount Bolingbroke), the secretary of state for foreign affairs (1710–15), and Robert Harley (Earl of Oxford), lord treasurer and prime minister (1711–1714). Swift recorded his experiences and thoughts during this difficult time in a long series of letters to Esther Johnson, collected and published after his death as A Journal to Stella. The animosity between the two Tory leaders eventually led to the dismissal of Harley in 1714. With the death of Queen Anne and accession of George I that year, the Whigs returned to power, and the Tory leaders were tried for treason for conducting secret negotiations with France.Also during these years in London, Swift became acquainted with the Vanhomrigh family (Dutch merchants who had settled in Ireland, then moved to London) and became involved with one of the daughters, Esther. Swift furnished Esther with the nickname \"Vanessa\" (derived by adding \"Essa\", a pet form of Esther, to the \"Van\" of her surname, Vanhomrigh), and she features as one of the main characters in his poem Cadenus and Vanessa. The poem and their correspondence suggest that Esther was infatuated with Swift, and that he may have reciprocated her affections, only to regret this and then try to break off the relationship.[15] Esther followed Swift to Ireland in 1714, and settled at her old family home, Celbridge Abbey. Their uneasy relationship continued for some years; then there appears to have been a confrontation, possibly involving Esther Johnson. Esther Vanhomrigh died in 1723 at the age of 35, having destroyed the will she had made in Swift's favour.[16] Another lady with whom he had a close but less intense relationship was Anne Long, a toast of the Kit-Cat Club.Before the fall of the Tory government, Swift hoped that his services would be rewarded with a church appointment in England. However, Queen Anne appeared to have taken a dislike to Swift and thwarted these efforts. Her dislike has been attributed to The Tale of a Tub, which she thought blasphemous, compounded by The Windsor Prophecy, where Swift, with a surprising lack of tact, advised the Queen on which of her bedchamber ladies she should and should not trust.[17] The best position his friends could secure for him was the Deanery of St Patrick's; this was not in the Queen's gift and Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, made it clear that Swift would not have received the preferment if she could have prevented it.[18] With the return of the Whigs, Swift's best move was to leave England and he returned to Ireland in disappointment, a virtual exile, to live \"like a rat in a hole\".[19]Once in Ireland, however, Swift began to turn his pamphleteering skills in support of Irish causes, producing some of his most memorable works: Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture (1720), Drapier's Letters (1724), and A Modest Proposal (1729), earning him the status of an Irish patriot.[20] This new role was unwelcome to the Government, which made clumsy attempts to silence him. His printer, Edward Waters, was convicted of seditious libel in 1720, but four years later a grand jury refused to find that the Drapier's Letters (which, though written under a pseudonym, were universally known to be Swift's work) were seditious.[21] Swift responded with an attack on the Irish judiciary almost unparalleled in its ferocity, his principal target being the \"vile and profligate villain\" William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.[22]Also during these years, he began writing his masterpiece, Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, in Four Parts, by Lemuel Gulliver, first a surgeon, and then a captain of several ships, better known as Gulliver's Travels. Much of the material reflects his political experiences of the preceding decade. For instance, the episode in which the giant Gulliver puts out the Lilliputian palace fire by urinating on it can be seen as a metaphor for the Tories' illegal peace treaty; having done a good thing in an unfortunate manner. In 1726 he paid a long-deferred visit to London,[23] taking with him the manuscript of Gulliver's Travels. During his visit he stayed with his old friends Alexander Pope, John Arbuthnot and John Gay, who helped him arrange for the anonymous publication of his book. First published in November 1726, it was an immediate hit, with a total of three printings that year and another in early 1727. French, German, and Dutch translations appeared in 1727, and pirated copies were printed in Ireland.Swift returned to England one more time in 1727 and stayed with Alexander Pope once again. The visit was cut short when Swift received word that Esther Johnson was dying, and rushed back home to be with her.[23] On 28 January 1728, Esther Johnson died; Swift had prayed at her bedside, even composing prayers for her comfort. Swift could not bear to be present at the end, but on the night of her death he began to write his The Death of Mrs Johnson. He was too ill to attend the funeral at St Patrick's.[23] Many years later, a lock of hair, assumed to be Esther Johnson's, was found in his desk, wrapped in a paper bearing the words, \"Only a woman's hair\".Death became a frequent feature of Swift's life from this point. In 1731 he wrote Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift, his own obituary published in 1739. In 1732, his good friend and collaborator John Gay died. In 1735, John Arbuthnot, another friend from his days in London, died. In 1738 Swift began to show signs of illness, and in 1742 he may have suffered a stroke, losing the ability to speak and realising his worst fears of becoming mentally disabled. (\"I shall be like that tree,\" he once said, \"I shall die at the top.\")[24] He became increasingly quarrelsome, and long-standing friendships, like that with Thomas Sheridan, ended without sufficient cause. To protect him from unscrupulous hangers on, who had begun to prey on the great man, his closest companions had him declared of \"unsound mind and memory\". However, it was long believed by many that Swift was actually insane at this point. In his book Literature and Western Man, author J. B. Priestley even cites the final chapters of Gulliver's Travels as proof of Swift's approaching \"insanity\".In part VIII of his series, The Story of Civilization, Will Durant describes the final years of Swift's life as such:\"Definite symptoms of madness appeared in 1738. In 1741 guardians were appointed to take care of his affairs and watch lest in his outbursts of violence he should do himself harm. In 1742 he suffered great pain from the inflammation of his left eye, which swelled to the size of an egg; five attendants had to restrain him from tearing out his eye. He went a whole year without uttering a word.\"[25]In 1744, Alexander Pope died. Then on 19 October 1745, Swift, at nearly 80, died.[26] After being laid out in public view for the people of Dublin to pay their last respects, he was buried in his own cathedral by Esther Johnson's side, in accordance with his wishes. The bulk of his fortune (£12,000) was left to found a hospital for the mentally ill, originally known as St Patrick’s Hospital for Imbeciles, which opened in 1757, and which still exists as a psychiatric hospital.[26]Jonathan Swift wrote his own epitaph:Hic depositum est Corpus IONATHAN SWIFT S.T.D. Hujus Ecclesiæ Cathedralis Decani, Ubi sæva Indignatio Ulterius Cor lacerare nequit, Abi Viator Et imitare, si poteris, Strenuum pro virili Libertatis Vindicatorem.  Obiit 19º Die Mensis Octobris A.D. 1745 Anno Ætatis 78º.Here is laid the Body of Jonathan Swift, Doctor of Sacred Theology, Dean of this Cathedral Church,  where fierce Indignation can no longer injure the Heart. Go forth, Voyager, and copy, if you can, this vigorous (to the best of his ability) Champion of Liberty.  He died on the 19th Day of the Month of October, A.D. 1745, in the 78th Year of his Age.W. B. Yeats poetically translated it from the Latin as:Swift was a prolific writer, notable for his satires. The most recent collection of his prose works (Herbert Davis, ed. Basil Blackwell, 1965–) comprises fourteen volumes. A recent edition of his complete poetry (Pat Rodges, ed. Penguin, 1983) is 953 pages long. One edition of his correspondence (David Woolley, ed. P. Lang, 1999) fills three volumes.Swift's first major prose work, A Tale of a Tub, demonstrates many of the themes and stylistic techniques he would employ in his later work. It is at once wildly playful and funny while being pointed and harshly critical of its targets. In its main thread, the Tale recounts the exploits of three sons, representing the main threads of Christianity, who receive a bequest from their father of a coat each, with the added instructions to make no alterations whatsoever. However, the sons soon find that their coats have fallen out of current fashion, and begin to look for loopholes in their father's will that will let them make the needed alterations. As each finds his own means of getting around their father's admonition, they struggle with each other for power and dominance. Inserted into this story, in alternating chapters, the narrator includes a series of whimsical \"digressions\" on various subjects.In 1690, Sir William Temple, Swift's patron, published An Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning a defence of classical writing (see Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns), holding up the Epistles of Phalaris as an example. William Wotton responded to Temple with Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning (1694), showing that the Epistles were a later forgery. A response by the supporters of the Ancients was then made by Charles Boyle (later the 4th Earl of Orrery and father of Swift's first biographer). A further retort on the Modern side came from Richard Bentley, one of the pre-eminent scholars of the day, in his essay Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris (1699). The final words on the topic belong to Swift in his Battle of the Books (1697, published 1704) in which he makes a humorous defence on behalf of Temple and the cause of the Ancients.In 1708, a cobbler named John Partridge published a popular almanac of astrological predictions. Because Partridge falsely determined the deaths of several church officials, Swift attacked Partridge in Predictions for the Ensuing Year by Isaac Bickerstaff, a parody predicting that Partridge would die on 29 March. Swift followed up with a pamphlet issued on 30 March claiming that Partridge had in fact died, which was widely believed despite Partridge's statements to the contrary. According to other sources,[citation needed] Richard Steele uses the personae of Isaac Bickerstaff and was the one who wrote about the \"death\" of John Partridge and published it in The Spectator, not Jonathan Swift.Drapier's Letters (1724) was a series of pamphlets against the monopoly granted by the English government to William Wood to provide the Irish with copper coinage. It was widely believed that Wood would need to flood Ireland with debased coinage in order to make a profit. In these \"letters\" Swift posed as a shop-keeper—a draper—to criticise the plan. Swift's writing was so effective in undermining opinion in the project that a reward was offered by the government to anyone disclosing the true identity of the author. Though hardly a secret (on returning to Dublin after one of his trips to England, Swift was greeted with a banner, \"Welcome Home, Drapier\") no one turned Swift in, although there was an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the publisher Harding.[27] The government eventually resorted to hiring none other than Sir Isaac Newton to certify the soundness of Wood's coinage to counter Swift's accusations. In \"Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift\" (1739) Swift recalled this as one of his best achievements.Gulliver's Travels, a large portion of which Swift wrote at Woodbrook House in County Laois, was published in 1726. It is regarded as his masterpiece. As with his other writings, the Travels was published under a pseudonym, the fictional Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon and later a sea captain. Some of the correspondence between printer Benj. Motte and Gulliver's also-fictional cousin negotiating the book's publication has survived. Though it has often been mistakenly thought of and published in bowdlerised form as a children's book, it is a great and sophisticated satire of human nature based on Swift's experience of his times. Gulliver's Travels is an anatomy of human nature, a sardonic looking-glass, often criticised for its apparent misanthropy. It asks its readers to refute it, to deny that it has adequately characterised human nature and society. Each of the four books—recounting four voyages to mostly fictional exotic lands—has a different theme, but all are attempts to deflate human pride. Critics hail the work as a satiric reflection on the shortcomings of Enlightenment thought.In 1729, Swift published A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland Being a Burden on Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick, a satire in which the narrator, with intentionally grotesque arguments, recommends that Ireland's poor escape their poverty by selling their children as food to the rich: \"I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food...\" Following the satirical form, he introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by deriding them:Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients...taxing our absentees...using [nothing] except what is of our own growth and manufacture...rejecting...foreign luxury...introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance...learning to love our country...quitting our animosities and factions...teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants....Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.John Ruskin named him as one of the three people in history who were the most influential for him.[29]George Orwell named him as one of the writers he most admired, despite disagreeing with him on almost every moral and political issue.[30] Modernist poet Edith Sitwell wrote a fictional biography of Switft titled in I Live Under a Black Sun published in 1937.[31]Swift crater, a crater on Mars's moon Deimos, is named after Jonathan Swift, who predicted the existence of the moons of Mars.[32]In honour of Swift's long-time residence in Trim, there are several monuments in the town marking his legacy. Most notable is Swift's Street, named after him. Trim also holds a recurring festival in honour of Swift, called the 'Trim Swift Festival'.Jake Arnott features him in his 2017 novel The Fatal Tree.[33]Online

giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, literally \"black and white cat-foot\"; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo, literally \"big bear cat\"),[3] also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear[4] native to south central China.[1] It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name \"giant panda\" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.[5] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[6][7]The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.[8] As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.The giant panda is a conservation reliant vulnerable species.[9][10] A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country.[11] As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries.[12] Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild,[11] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.[13] Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise.[14] In March 2015, Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864 individuals.[15] In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\"[10] (it did not believe there was enough certainty yet to do so in 2008[16]).While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda appears at least as commonly. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons.[17] However, molecular studies suggest the giant panda is a true bear and part of the family Ursidae,[4][18] though it differentiated early in history from the main ursine stock. The giant panda's closest extant relative is the spectacled bear of South America.[19] The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.[20]Despite the shared name, habitat type, and diet, as well as a unique enlarged bone called the pseudo thumb (which helps them grip the bamboo shoots they eat) the giant panda and red panda are only distantly related.The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found.[21] The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world originally applied this name to the red panda. Until 1901, when it was erroneously stated to be related to the red panda, the giant panda was known as \"black and white cat-footed animal\" (Ailuropus melanoleucus).[22]In most encyclopedic sources, the name \"panda\" or \"common panda\" originally referred to the lesser-known red panda,[23] thus necessitating the inclusion of \"giant\" and \"lesser/red\" prefixes in front of the names. Even in 2013, the Encyclopædia Britannica still used \"giant panda\" or \"panda bear\" for the bear,[24] and simply \"panda\" for the Ailuridae,[25] despite the popular usage of the word \"panda\".Since the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear 20 different names, such as huāxióng (花熊 \"spotted bear\") and zhúxióng (竹熊 \"bamboo bear\").[26] The most popular names in China today is dàxióngmāo (大熊貓 literally \"giant bear cat\"), or simply xióngmāo (熊貓 \"bear cat\"). The name xióngmāo (熊貓 \"bear cat\") was originally used to describe the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), but since giant panda was thought to be closely related to red panda, dàxióngmāo (大熊貓) was named relatively.[26]In Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted dàmāoxióng (大貓熊 \"giant cat bear\"), though many encyclopediae and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the \"bear cat\" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, \"bear\" instead of \"cat\" is the base noun, making this name more grammatically and logically correct, which may have led to the popular choice despite official writings.[26] This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident.[27][28]Two subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, color patterns, and population genetics (Wan et al., 2005).A detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012[31] confirms that the separation of the Qinlin population occurred about 300,000 years ago, and reveals that the non-Qinlin population further diverged into two groups, named the Minshan and the Qionglai-Daxiangling-Xiaoxiangling-Liangshan group respectively, about 2,800 years ago.[32]The giant panda has luxuriant black-and-white fur. Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 m (4 to 6 ft) long, including a tail of about 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in), and 60 to 90 cm (2.0 to 3.0 ft) tall at the shoulder.[33][34] Males can weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb).[35] Females (generally 10–20% smaller than males)[36] can weigh as little as 70 kg (150 lb), but can also weigh up to 125 kg (276 lb).[9][33][37] Average adult weight is 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb).[38]The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat.[39] The giant panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.[39] The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa.[40][41] A 110.45 kg (243.5 lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292.[citation needed] Another study had a 117.5 kg (259 lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.[42]The giant panda's paw has a \"thumb\" and five fingers; the \"thumb\" – actually a modified sesamoid bone – helps it to hold bamboo while eating.[43] Stephen Jay Gould discusses this feature in his book of essays on evolution and biology, The Panda's Thumb.The giant panda's tail, measuring 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in), is the second-longest in the bear family. (The longest belongs to the sloth bear.)[36]The giant panda typically lives around 20 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity.[44] A female named Jia Jia was the oldest giant panda ever in captivity, born in 1978 and died at an age of 38 on October 16, 2016.[45]A seven-year-old female named Jin Yi died in 2014 in a zoo in Zhengzhou, China, after showing symptoms of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. It was found that the cause of death was toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii and infecting most warm-blooded animals, including humans.[46]The giant panda genome was sequenced in 2009 using Illumina dye sequencing.[47] Its genome contains 20 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes.The giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly Sichuan Province.[48] Giant pandas are generally solitary,[49] and each adult has a defined territory, and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather.[50] After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.[51]Pandas were thought to fall into the crepuscular category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn and dusk; however, Jindong Zhang found that pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with activity peaks in the morning, afternoon and midnight. Due to their sheer size, pandas do not need to fear predators like other herbivores. They can therefore be active at any time of the day.[52]Pandas communicate through vocalization and scent marking such as clawing trees or spraying urine.[9] They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate, which is similar to other subtropical mammals, and will instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures.[53] Pandas rely primarily on spatial memory rather than visual memory.[54]Though the panda is often assumed to be docile, it has been known to attack humans, presumably out of irritation rather than aggression.[55][56][57]Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo.[44] However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes,[58] and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[59][60] Pandas are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation.[61] The giant panda is a \"highly specialized\" animal with \"unique adaptations\", and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years.[49] The average giant panda eats as much as 9 to 14 kg (20 to 30 lb) of bamboo shoots a day to compensate for its low level of energy digestibility. Ingestion of such a large quantity of material is possible because of the rapid passage of large amounts of indigestible plant material through the short, straight digestive tract.[62][63] It is also noted, however, that such rapid passage of digesta limits the potential of microbial digestion in the gastrointestinal tract,[62] limiting alternative forms of digestion. Given this voluminous diet, the giant panda defecates up to 40 times a day.[64] The limited energy input imposed on it by its diet has affected the panda's behavior. The giant panda tends to limit its social interactions and avoids steeply sloping terrain to limit its energy expenditures.[65]Two of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are adaptations to its bamboo diet. Anthropologist Russell Ciochon observed: \"[much] like the vegetarian gorilla, the low body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo.\"[65] Similarly, the giant panda's round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw.[65] Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.The morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya), it only became herbivorous some 2-2.4 mya with the emergence of A. microta.[66][67] Genome sequencing of the giant panda suggests that the dietary switch could have initiated from the loss of the sole T1R1/T1R3 umami taste receptor, resulting from two frameshift mutations within the T1R1 exons.[68] Umami taste corresponds to high levels of glutamate as found in meat, and may have thus altered the food choice of the giant panda.[69] Although the pseudogenization of the umami taste receptor in Ailuropoda coincides with the dietary switch to herbivory, it is likely a result of, and not the reason for, the dietary change.[67][68][69] The mutation time for the T1R1 gene in the giant panda is estimated to 4.2 mya[67] while fossil evidence indicates bamboo consumption in the giant panda species at least 7 mya,[66] signifying that although complete herbivory occurred around 2 mya, the dietary switch was initiated prior to T1R1 loss-of-function.Pandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild, such as Fargesia dracocephala[70] and Fargesia rufa.[71] Only a few bamboo species are widespread at the high altitudes pandas now inhabit. Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less.[72]Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth, and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.[73]Pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. For six years, scientists studied six pandas tagged with GPS collars at the Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. They took note of their foraging and mating habits, and analysed samples of their food and feces. The pandas would move from the valleys in to the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn. During the summer months bamboo shoots rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low calcium rates in the pandas and during breeding season the pandas would trek back down to eat bamboo leaves rich in calcium.[74]Initially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination, as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured.[76] This led some scientists to try extreme methods, such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating[77] and giving the males sildenafil (commonly known as \"Viagra\").[78] Only recently have researchers started having success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the American black bear, a thriving bear species. The normal reproductive rate is considered to be one young every two years.[14][48]Giant pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of four and eight, and may be reproductive until age 20.[79] The mating season is between March and May, when a female goes into estrus, which lasts for two or three days and only occurs once a year.[80] When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts her from behind. Copulation time is short, ranging from 30 seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilization. The gestation period ranges from 95 to 160 days.[80]Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies.[81] If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild. The mother will select the stronger of the cubs, and the weaker will die. The mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two cubs, since she does not store fat.[82] The father has no part in helping raise the cub.When the cub is first born, it is pink, blind, and toothless,[83] weighing only 90 to 130 grams (3.2 to 4.6 ounces), or about 1/800th of the mother's weight,[17] proportionally the smallest baby of any placental mammal.[84] It nurses from its mother's breast six to 14 times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time. For three to four hours, the mother may leave the den to feed, which leaves the cub defenseless. One to two weeks after birth, the cub's skin turns gray where its hair will eventually become black. A slight pink color may appear on cub's fur, as a result of a chemical reaction between the fur and its mother's saliva. A month after birth, the color pattern of the cub's fur is fully developed. Its fur is very soft and coarsens with age. The cub begins to crawl at 75 to 80 days;[17] mothers play with their cubs by rolling and wrestling with them. The cubs can eat small quantities of bamboo after six months,[85] though mother's milk remains the primary food source for most of the first year. Giant panda cubs weigh 45 kg (100 pounds) at one year, and live with their mothers until they are 18 months to two years old. The interval between births in the wild is generally two years.In July 2009, Chinese scientists confirmed the birth of the first cub to be successfully conceived through artificial insemination using frozen sperm.[86] The cub was born at 07:41 on 23 July that year in Sichuan as the third cub of You You, an 11-year-old.[86][87][88] The technique for freezing the sperm in liquid nitrogen was first developed in 1980 and the first birth was hailed as a solution to the problem of lessening giant panda semen availability, which had led to inbreeding.[88][89] Panda semen, which can be frozen for decades, could be shared between different zoos to save the species.[86][87] It is expected that zoos in destinations such as San Diego in the United States and Mexico City will now be able to provide their own semen to inseminate more giant pandas.[89] In August 2014, a rare birth of panda triplets was announced in China; it was the fourth of such births ever reported.[90]Attempts have also been made to reproduce giant pandas by interspecific pregnancy by implanting cloned panda embryos into the uterus of an animal of another species. This has resulted in panda fetuses, but no live births.[91]In the past, pandas were thought to be rare and noble creatures – the Empress Dowager Bo was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of Emperor Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in Ancient China, pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts to control menses as described in the Qin Dynasty encyclopedia Erya.[92]The creature named mo (貘) mentioned in some ancient books has been interpreted as giant panda.[92] The dictionary Shuowen Jiezi (Eastern Han Dynasty) says that the mo, from Shu (Sichuan), is bear-like, but yellow-and-black,[93] although the older Erya describes mo simply as a \"white leopard\".[94] The interpretation of the legendary fierce creature pixiu (貔貅) as referring to the giant panda is also common.[95]During the reign of the Yongle Emperor (early 15th century), his relative from Kaifeng sent him a captured zouyu (騶虞), and another zouyu was sighted in Shandong. Zouyu is a legendary \"righteous\" animal, which, similarly to a qilin, only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere monarch. It is said to be fierce as a tiger, but gentle and strictly vegetarian, and described in some books as a white tiger with black spots. Puzzled about the real zoological identity of the creature captured during the Yongle era, J.J.L. Duyvendak exclaims, \"Can it possibly have been a Pandah?\"[96]The comparative obscurity of the giant panda throughout most of China's history is illustrated by the fact that, despite there being a number of depictions of bears in Chinese art starting from its most ancient times, and the bamboo being one of the favorite subjects for Chinese painters, there are no known pre-20th-century artistic representations of giant pandas.The West first learned of the giant panda on 11 March 1869, when the French missionary Armand David[17] received a skin from a hunter. The first Westerner known to have seen a living giant panda is the German zoologist Hugo Weigold, who purchased a cub in 1916. Kermit and Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., became the first Westerners to shoot a panda, on an expedition funded by the Field Museum of Natural History in the 1920s. In 1936, Ruth Harkness became the first Westerner to bring back a live giant panda, a cub named Su Lin[97] which went to live at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. In 1938, five giant pandas were sent to London.[98][99] Activities such as these were halted because of wars; in subsequent decades, the West knew little of giant pandas.Gifts of giant pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part of the diplomacy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the 1970s, as it marked some of the first cultural exchanges between the PRC and the West. This practice has been termed \"panda diplomacy\".By 1984, however, pandas were no longer given as gifts. Instead, the PRC began to offer pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans, under terms including a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of the PRC. Since 1998, because of a WWF lawsuit, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service allows a US zoo to import a panda only if the zoo can ensure the PRC will channel more than half of its loan fee into conservation efforts for the giant panda and its habitat.In May 2005, the PRC offered a breeding pair to Taiwan. The issue became embroiled in cross-Strait relations – both over the underlying symbolism, and over technical issues such as whether the transfer would be considered \"domestic\" or \"international\", or whether any true conservation purpose would be served by the exchange.[100] A contest in 2006 to name the pandas was held in the mainland, resulting in the politically charged names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan (from tuanyuan, meaning \"reunion\", i.e. \"reunification\"). PRC's offer was initially rejected by Chen Shui-bian, then President of Taiwan. However, when Ma Ying-jeou assumed the presidency in 2008, the offer was accepted, and the pandas arrived in December of that year.[101]Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating biofuels from bamboo and other plant materials.[102]The giant panda is a vulnerable species, threatened by continued habitat loss and habitat fragmentation,[103] and by a very low birthrate, both in the wild and in captivity.[44] Its range is currently confined to a small portion on the western edge of its historical range, which stretched through southern and eastern China, northern Myanmar, and northern Vietnam.[1]The giant panda has been a target of poaching by locals since ancient times and by foreigners since it was introduced to the West. Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat, and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. During the Cultural Revolution, all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were stopped. After the Chinese economic reform, demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the black market, acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.Though the Wolong National Nature Reserve was set up by the PRC government in 1958 to save the declining panda population, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made, owing to inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas was to cage them. As a result, pandas were caged at any sign of decline, and suffered from terrible conditions. Because of pollution and destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a rare species.In 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes DNA from panda droppings, scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000.[44] In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves two decades ago.[13] As the species has been reclassified to \"vulnerable\" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the State Forestry Administration of China announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.[104]The giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a UNESCO World Heritage Site designation. The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, located in the southwest Sichuan province and covering seven natural reserves, were inscribed onto the World Heritage List in 2006.[105][106]Not all conservationists agree that the money spent on conserving pandas is well spent. Chris Packham has argued that the breeding of pandas in captivity is \"pointless\" because \"there is not enough habitat left to sustain them\".[107] Packham argues that the money spent on pandas would be better spent elsewhere,[107] and has said he would \"eat the last panda if I could have all the money we have spent on panda conservation put back on the table for me to do more sensible things with\",[108] though he has apologized for upsetting people who like pandas.[109] He points out, \"The panda is possibly one of the grossest wastes of conservation money in the last half century.\"[108] However, a 2015 paper found that the giant panda can serve as an umbrella species as the preservation of their habitat also helps other endemic species in China, including 70% of the country's forest birds, 70% of mammals and 31% of amphibians.[110]In 2012, Earthwatch Institute, a global nonprofit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct important environmental research, launched a program called \"On the Trail of Giant Panda\". This program, based in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, allows volunteers to work up close with pandas cared for in captivity, and help them adapt to life in the wild, so that they may breed, and live longer and healthier lives.[111]Pandas have been kept in zoos as early as the Western Han Dynasty in China, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of exotic animals in the capital Chang'an (present Xi'an). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos.[112]Chi Chi at the London Zoo became very popular. This influenced the World Wildlife Fund to use a panda as its symbol.[113]A 2006 New York Times article[114] outlined the economics of keeping pandas, which costs five times more than that of the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1 million a year in fees, as part of a typical ten-year contract. San Diego's contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost.[115] The last contract, with the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, Tennessee, ended in 2013.[114]AsiaMany zoos and breeding centers in China house giant pandas.

The North-East Pacific is home to the Juan de Fuca plate—smallest of Earth’s 12 tectonic plates. Its small size and close proximity to the coast gives NEPTUNE Canada a unique opportunity to observe tectonic processes. NEPTUNE Canada is built to provide continuous observations for 25 years. The time-series data gathered will allow scientists to study long-term changes over the life of the project. Instruments comprising the undersea observatory will operate at depths ranging from 17 to 2,660 m. Hundreds of instruments have been connected to the Internet by way of shielded cables carrying both power and fibre-optic communication lines. A database will archive and provide networked access to all archived data. Taking advantage of this platform, scientists collaborating with NEPTUNE are expected to conduct thousands of unique experiments over the life of the project.\nThe NEPTUNE Ocean Observatory project is part of Ocean Networks Canada which is a University of Victoria initiative.

FISHER","text":"GALWAY FISHER:Galway (/ˈɡɔːlweɪ/; Irish: Gaillimh, pronounced [ˈɡalʲɪvʲ]) is a city in the West of Ireland in the province of Connacht. Galway City Council is the local authority for the city. Galway lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay and is surrounded by County Galway. It is the fourth most populous urban area in the Republic of Ireland and the sixth most populous city in the island of Ireland. According to the 2016 Irish Census, Galway city has a population of 79,504; however, the rural county agglomeration is far bigger.Galway will be European Capital of Culture in 2020, alongside Rijeka, Croatia.The city's name is from the Irish name for Abhainn na Gaillimhe (\"Galway\"), which formed the western boundary of the earliest settlement, Dún Bhun na Gaillimhe \"Fort at the mouth of the Gaillimh\".[4] (Mythical and alternative derivations of the name are given in History of Galway).Historically, the name was Anglicised as Galliv,[5] which is closer to the Irish pronunciation as is the city's name in Latin, Galvia.\nThe city also bears the nickname \"The City of the Tribes\" (Irish: Cathair na dTreabh) because of the fourteen merchant families called the \"tribes of Galway\"[6] led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period. The term tribes was a derogatory one, because the merchants saw themselves as Anglo-Irish and were loyal to the King during the English Civil War.[citation needed] They later adopted the term as a badge of honour and pride in defiance of the town's Cromwellian occupier. Residents of the city refer to themselves as \"Galwegians\".Dún Bhun na Gaillimhe (\"Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh\") was constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088–1156). Eventually, a small settlement grew up around this fort. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, Galway fort was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city.[citation needed]\nHistorical population. This led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas Óge Martyn, stated \"From the Ferocious O'Flahertys may God protect us\". A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway's Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying \"neither O’ nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway\" without permission. During the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the \"The Tribes of Galway\". The city thrived on international trade, and in the Middle Ages, it was the principal Irish port for trade with Spain and France. The most famous reminder of those days is ceann an bhalla (\"the end of the wall\"), now known as the Spanish Arch, constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin (1519–20). In 1477 Christopher Columbus visited Galway, possibly stopping off on a voyage to Iceland or the Faroe Islands. Seven or eight years later, he noted in the margin of his copy of Imago Mundi:Men of Cathay have come from the west. [Of this] we have seen many signs. And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman, of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks [or timbers? or a boat made of such?]The most likely explanation for these bodies is that they were Inuit swept eastward by the North Atlantic Current.[4]During the 16th and 17th centuries Galway remained loyal to the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At the end of the 17th century the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city suffered further under the potato famines of 1845–1852, and it did not fully recover until the period of strong economic growth of the late 20th century (see Celtic Tiger).","path":[46688,-6.207,53.3455,46417,-6.2075,53.34483,46137,-6.205333,53.34383,45977,-6.201167,53.34333,45867,-6.1975,53.34333,45726,-6.192,53.34317,45587,-6.186333,53.343,45437,-6.18,53.34317,45308,-6.174333,53.343,45168,-6.167167,53.34333,45017,-6.157166,53.3435,44877,-6.1455,53.34317,44728,-6.133333,53.34233,44597,-6.122334,53.3415,44468,-6.111333,53.34083,44317,-6.099,53.33883,44177,-6.088,53.3365,44048,-6.077833,53.334,43928,-6.068833,53.33133,43778,-6.059333,53.32567,43606,-6.049667,53.31833,43458,-6.041333,53.31183,43317,-6.0335,53.30567,43117,-6.0235,53.29817,42937,-6.016833,53.29267,42788,-6.009666,53.28633,42667,-6.003833,53.281,42488,-5.995833,53.27234,42367,-5.991167,53.26633,42168,-5.9855,53.25583,42027,-5.983,53.24817,41878,-5.9805,53.24,41727,-5.977833,53.23167,41556,-5.975,53.2225,41407,-5.972333,53.21433,41277,-5.969833,53.20716,41088,-5.9665,53.197,40937,-5.963666,53.18867,40796,-5.961167,53.181,40647,-5.9585,53.17283,40507,-5.956167,53.165,40378,-5.953833,53.15783,40226,-5.951,53.1495,40076,-5.948167,53.141,39896,-5.944667,53.131,39748,-5.941833,53.12267,39618,-5.9395,53.11567,39498,-5.9375,53.10917,39357,-5.935333,53.10167,39207,-5.933167,53.0935,39067,-5.931,53.08583,38926,-5.929,53.07883,38776,-5.927333,53.07267,38558,-5.925,53.06433,38397,-5.923,53.05767,38248,-5.9205,53.04967,38128,-5.918667,53.04317,37986,-5.9165,53.03567,37838,-5.914333,53.02767,37687,-5.912,53.01983,37537,-5.9095,53.01167,37387,-5.907333,53.00383,37177,-5.904,52.99283,37037,-5.901667,52.9855,36818,-5.8985,52.97433,36677,-5.8965,52.967,36538,-5.894166,52.95984,36387,-5.891833,52.95217,36257,-5.889833,52.94567,36036,-5.8865,52.93467,35887,-5.884167,52.92733,35747,-5.882,52.92033,35597,-5.879667,52.913,35377,-5.876333,52.90217,35230,-5.873667,52.895,35086,-5.874333,52.88766,34946,-5.875333,52.88066,34788,-5.876667,52.87267,34628,-5.877833,52.86467,34417,-5.8795,52.85417,34268,-5.8805,52.84683,34127,-5.8815,52.83983,33977,-5.882667,52.83233,33758,-5.884,52.8215,33617,-5.885,52.81467,33458,-5.886,52.80684,33316,-5.886833,52.8,33187,-5.887667,52.79367,33046,-5.8885,52.78683,32876,-5.8895,52.77867,32698,-5.890666,52.76983,32537,-5.891667,52.76217,32398,-5.8925,52.75533,32248,-5.893167,52.74817,32108,-5.893833,52.7415,31957,-5.894333,52.73433,31797,-5.894667,52.72683,31638,-5.895167,52.71933,31467,-5.895667,52.71117,31337,-5.895833,52.70483,31188,-5.896333,52.69767,31017,-5.896833,52.6895,30816,-5.8975,52.68,30666,-5.898167,52.67283,30568,-5.8985,52.66817,30426,-5.899,52.6615,30276,-5.8995,52.65467,30137,-5.899833,52.64817,29977,-5.9,52.641,29818,-5.900333,52.63383,29657,-5.9005,52.62667,29497,-5.900833,52.6195,29357,-5.901166,52.61317,29196,-5.9015,52.606,29047,-5.901834,52.59933,28887,-5.9025,52.59217,28748,-5.903,52.58583,28587,-5.903833,52.57867,28367,-5.905667,52.56867,28227,-5.906667,52.5625,28077,-5.907833,52.55567,27918,-5.909,52.5485,27758,-5.910167,52.54117,27598,-5.911167,52.53433,27436,-5.912,52.52717,27227,-5.912333,52.51817,27056,-5.9125,52.51083,26907,-5.912667,52.50417,26778,-5.913,52.49866,26577,-5.9135,52.48983,26417,-5.914333,52.483,26247,-5.915167,52.4755,26107,-5.916,52.46933,25956,-5.916833,52.46267,25816,-5.917666,52.45667,25676,-5.918334,52.4505,25517,-5.919167,52.44333,25377,-5.919833,52.43733,25217,-5.920833,52.43017,25077,-5.921667,52.424,24917,-5.9225,52.41683,24758,-5.923333,52.40967,24617,-5.924,52.4035,24476,-5.924833,52.39717,24318,-5.925667,52.39034,24177,-5.9265,52.384,23976,-5.927834,52.37517,23828,-5.928667,52.36867,23627,-5.929833,52.36,23467,-5.930666,52.353,23258,-5.9315,52.34383,23117,-5.932167,52.3375,22966,-5.933,52.33083,22817,-5.933667,52.32417,22657,-5.934667,52.317,22507,-5.9355,52.31017,22367,-5.935833,52.30383,22227,-5.936333,52.2975,22078,-5.936833,52.29067,21876,-5.9375,52.2815,21718,-5.938167,52.27433,21567,-5.938833,52.2675,21427,-5.939333,52.261,21278,-5.939833,52.25433,21127,-5.940333,52.24733,20917,-5.941333,52.2375,20767,-5.942167,52.2305,20557,-5.942833,52.22066,20417,-5.943666,52.21433,20297,-5.946833,52.20917,20177,-5.95,52.204,20057,-5.953166,52.19883,19898,-5.9575,52.192,19748,-5.961333,52.18567,19587,-5.965667,52.1785,19436,-5.9695,52.17216,19236,-5.974833,52.16333,19097,-5.9785,52.15733,18878,-5.984334,52.14767,18738,-5.988,52.14167,18598,-5.9915,52.13533,18421,-5.995167,52.12733,18216,-6.006166,52.12033,18067,-6.015,52.11533,17916,-6.023833,52.11033,17787,-6.031333,52.106,17647,-6.0395,52.10117,17497,-6.048333,52.09617,17357,-6.056667,52.09184,17137,-6.07,52.08484,16996,-6.078833,52.08033,16827,-6.089334,52.075,16697,-6.0975,52.07067,16548,-6.106833,52.06583,16388,-6.117,52.06067,16248,-6.125834,52.056,16107,-6.1345,52.0515,15948,-6.144166,52.046,15787,-6.1565,52.04284,15628,-6.169,52.04,15487,-6.18,52.0375,15278,-6.1965,52.03367,15137,-6.2075,52.031,14988,-6.219167,52.02833,14848,-6.230166,52.02567,14707,-6.241333,52.02317,14706,-6.241333,52.02317,14557,-6.253,52.02033,14406,-6.264833,52.01767,14267,-6.275667,52.01534,14127,-6.286833,52.013,13907,-6.3

ENDEAVOUR","text":"EUROPEAN ENDEAVOUR:The MS European Endeavour is a roll-on/roll-off passenger ferry which is owned and operated by P&O Ferries. P&O took delivery of the ship in October 2007 from Acciona Trasmediterránea. She is the 28th member of the current P&O fleet and is the second P&O ship to have carried the name European Endeavour; the first was subsequently operated as the MV Gardenia of Transeuropa Ferries, and was later scrapped in December 2016 under the name MV Star Fighter.The ship was built in 2000 for Merchant Ferries as Midnight Merchant for a planned service between Liverpool and Belfast, however the ship was chartered to Norfolkline for their new service between Dover and Dunkirk and remained on that route until July 2006 when she was replaced by one of three new ships for the service.In August 2006 she was chartered to Acciona Trasmediterránea for service in the Mediterranean and renamed El Greco registered under the Spanish flag.On 26 June 2007 it was announced that P&O Ferries had agreed to purchase the ship in order to meet the growing demand for space from haulage customers throughout its operations. The ship will primarily be used on the Dover–Calais route but also on P&O Ferries Irish Sea and North Sea routes to cover for the refit of other vessels.[3] The ship entered service with P&O on their Liverpool-Dublin route on 6 November 2007.The ship has been involved in two incidents. On 22 March 2008 the ships mooring ropes parted resulting is her drifting across the eastern entrance of Dover Harbour. The ship was assisted back to her berth by a Dover Harbour tug.[4] On 29 August 2008 the ship suffered a partial lost of electrical power which resulted in a collision with Linkspan 7 in Calais. European Endeavour's 'cow catcher', a metal structure welded to the bow to support the bow ramp when deployed, was demolished and significant damage was caused to the linkspan.[5]Due to a downturn in freight traffic P&O Ferries laid up the ship in Tilbury in May 2010. She was chartered to DFDS Seaways in August 2010 and early September 2010 to provide refit cover on the Birkenhead–Dublin and Belfast routes. On completion of this charter the ship was sent for its annual overhaul and then proceeded to Dunkerque for layup. She remained in Dunkerque until early February 2011 when she sailed for Liverpool in preparation for returning to service on the Liverpool-Dublin service replacing the M/V Norcape.It was P&O's intention that the ship would primarily be used between Dover and Calais but would also cover the refits of other ships on the following routes:-It was discovered that the ship was too wide to fit through the lock at Hull so she did not serve the routes from that port as intended. She was briefly used on a re-established Dover-Zeebrugge route but the service only lasted for one day due to lack of freight.The ship was one of four ordered for Merchant Ferries services on the Irish Sea. Collectively they are known as the Racehorses because of their naming.

ROGUE","text":"ARKLOW ROGUE:The Red Arrows, officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, is the aerobatics display team of the Royal Air Force based at RAF Scampton. The team was formed in late 1964 as an all-RAF team, replacing a number of unofficial teams that had been sponsored by RAF commands.The Red Arrows have a prominent place in British popular culture, with their aerobatic displays a fixture of British summer events.[1] The badge of the Red Arrows shows the aircraft in their trademark diamond nine formation, with the motto Éclat, a French word meaning \"brilliance\" or \"excellence\".Initially, they were equipped with seven Folland Gnat trainers inherited from the RAF Yellowjacks display team. This aircraft was chosen because it was less expensive to operate than front-line fighters. In their first season, they flew at 65 shows across Europe.

FRIGG","text":"STEN FRIGG:In Germanic mythology, Frigg (Old Norse), Frija (Old High German), Frea (Langobardic), and Frige (Old English) is a goddess. In nearly all sources, she is described as the wife of the god Odin. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is also connected with the goddess Fulla. The English weekday name Friday (etymologically Old English \"Frīge's day\") bears her name. Frigg is described as a goddess associated with foreknowledge and wisdom in Norse mythology, the northernmost branch of Germanic mythology and most extensively attested. Frigg is the wife of the major god Odin and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir, is famous for her foreknowledge, is associated with the goddesses Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, and Gná, and is ambiguously associated with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse \"Earth\"). The children of Frigg and Odin include the gleaming god Baldr. Due to significant thematic overlap, scholars have proposed a particular connection to the goddess Freyja.After Christianization, mention of Frigg continued to occur in Scandinavian folklore. In modern times, Frigg has appeared in modern popular culture, has been the subject of art, and receives modern veneration in Germanic Neopaganism.Etymology, Friday, and toponymy[edit]\nThe theonyms Frigg (Old Norse) and Frija (Old High German) are cognate forms—linguistic siblings of the same origin—that descend from a substantivized feminine of Proto-Germanic *frijaz (via Holtzmann's law). *frijaz descends from the same source (Proto-Indo-European) as the feminine Sanskrit noun priyā and the feminine Avestan noun fryā (both meaning \"own, dear, beloved\").In the modern period, an -a suffix is sometimes applied to denote femininity, resulting in the form Frigga.[2] This spelling also serves the purpose of distancing the goddess from the English word frig.The connection with and possible earlier identification of the goddess Freyja with Frigg in the Proto-Germanic period (Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis) is a matter of scholarly debate.The name Freyja is not attested outside of Scandinavia, like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir. This is in contrast to the name of the goddess Frigg, who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *Frijjō. Evidence does not exist for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Old Norse Freyja descends, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of surviving sources.Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"The English weekday name Friday comes from Old English \"Frīge's Day\" and is cognate with Old High German frîatac. Both weekday names are result of interpretatio germanica that occurred at or before the 3rd or 4th century CE, glossing the Latin weekday name dies Veneris 'Day of Venus'.Several place names refer to Frigg in what are now Norway and Sweden, although her name is altogether absent in recorded place names in Denmark.","path":[71716,-6.206385,53.34554,69736,-6.206378,53.34553,67936,-6.206413,53.34555,65775,-6.206373,53.34554,63975,-6.206412,53.34554,61995,-6.206403,53.34553,60015,-6.20639,53.34551,57855,-6.20641,53.34558,56235,-6.206392,53.34559,54076,-6.206365,53.34552,52275,-6.206427,53.34552,50475,-6.206432,53.3455,48495,-6.206415,53.3455,46515,-6.206367,53.34555,44535,-6.20641,53.34556,42555,-6.206392,53.34556,40755,-6.206365,53.34556,38595,-6.206353,53.34555,36615,-6.206398,53.34555,34635,-6.206423,53.34554,32835,-6.206383,53.34556,30855,-6.206373,53.34554,29056,-6.2064,53.34556,27569,-6.206422,53.34553,26229,-6.20628,53.34555,26100,-6.206315,53.34543,25980,-6.206217,53.34509,25850,-6.205827,53.34464,25678,-6.20536,53.34391,25520,-6.204682,53.34356,25230,-6.20051,53.34348,25050,-6.196035,53.34343,24889,-6.190393,53.34346,24718,-6.182193,53.34366,24510,-6.16837,53.34372,24360,-6.156617,53.34375,24240,-6.146719,53.34318,24118,-6.136402,53.34243,23959,-6.122608,53.34185,23808,-6.109374,53.34052,23669,-6.098047,53.33782,23540,-6.087503,53.33559,23399,-6.075593,53.33535,23249,-6.062743,53.33829,23110,-6.05195,53.34199,22980,-6.043345,53.34503,22839,-6.034685,53.34804,22650,-6.020215,53.3526,22508,-6.007107,53.35626,22369,-5.99426,53.35977,22229,-5.981184,53.36331,22088,-5.967977,53.36681,21959,-5.955525,53.36889,21750,-5.934935,53.37194,21620,-5.92242,53.37387,21500,-5.910712,53.37554,21359,-5.897,53.37641,21150,-5.877337,53.37381,21019,-5.866724,53.37022,20890,-5.857178,53.36538,20670,-5.841213,53.35733,20520,-5.830389,53.35188,20369,-5.81948,53.34651,20249,-5.810781,53.34217,20090,-5.79939,53.33647,19939,-5.78876,53.33118,19788,-5.778093,53.32588,19649,-5.768173,53.32087,19500,-5.757608,53.31545,19300,-5.743622,53.30801,19120,-5.731013,53.30111,18978,-5.7208,53.29584,18849,-5.711226,53.29101,18708,-5.700861,53.28574,18568,-5.690792,53.28067,18420,-5.679837,53.27524,18279,-5.66978,53.27012,18129,-5.658896,53.26479,17990,-5.648489,53.25987,17848,-5.63809,53.25495,17710,-5.627996,53.24977,17570,-5.61832,53.24435,17428,-5.608398,53.23892,17280,-5.598135,53.23329,17160,-5.589688,53.22883,17030,-5.58058,53.22396,16880,-5.570044,53.21825,16749,-5.560755,53.21338,16530,-5.545092,53.20496,16389,-5.535215,53.19961,16248,-5.525456,53.19416,16099,-5.514998,53.18835,15879,-5.499237,53.18003,15719,-5.487835,53.17392,15560,-5.476472,53.16779,15440,-5.467933,53.16317,15320,-5.459173,53.15863,15168,-5.448105,53.15283,15029,-5.43805,53.14756,14889,-5.427518,53.14237,14740,-5.415912,53.13706,14600,-5.405147,53.13206,14460,-5.394627,53.12694,14319,-5.384115,53.12182,14189,-5.374395,53.117,14069,-5.365422,53.11246,13930,-5.354858,53.10721,13778,-5.343343,53.10153,13630,-5.332168,53.09591,13430,-5.317135,53.08836,13230,-5.302197,53.0807,13090,-5.291507,53.07549,12878,-5.276017,53.06675,12719,-5.265117,53.05953,12512,-5.251593,53.05033,12389,-5.25011,53.04308,12230,-5.254218,53.03318,12089,-5.257777,53.02449,11949,-5.26133,53.0158,11799,-5.26517,53.0065,11649,-5.26912,52.99729,11439,-5.274627,52.98441,11289,-5.278525,52.97527,11150,-5.282427,52.96675,11009,-5.28635,52.95828,10869,-5.290232,52.94965,10726,-5.29412,52.9408,10587,-5.297892,52.93218,10444,-5.301688,52.92317,10303,-5.305343,52.91444,10163,-5.309015,52.90575,10014,-5.312858,52.89654,9813,-5.318357,52.88425,9673,-5.322335,52.87566,9513,-5.326823,52.86588,9373,-5.330817,52.85727,9222,-5.335173,52.84792,9081,-5.339195,52.83926,8938,-5.343325,52.83028,8739,-5.348862,52.81791,8601,-5.352823,52.80927,8458,-5.356952,52.80023,8260,-5.362478,52.78777,8128,-5.366192,52.77945,7995,-5.369848,52.77104,7851,-5.373767,52.76183,7654,-5.379065,52.74915,7515,-5.382582,52.74026,7383,-5.385839,52.73178,7173,-5.391032,52.71831,7035,-5.394474,52.70948,6897,-5.397982,52.70067,6699,-5.403062,52.68803,6561,-5.4065,52.67923,6423,-5.410073,52.6704,6285,-5.413623,52.66155,6142,-5.417307,52.65231,6009,-5.420795,52.64386,5883,-5.424085,52.63579,5739,-5.427802,52.62651,5601,-5.431462,52.61766,5457,-5.435313,52.60839,5302,-5.439515,52.59836,5164,-5.443198,52.58948,5025,-5.446872,52.58064,4887,-5.45056,52.5718,4756,-5.45412,52.56335,4623,-5.457738,52.55491,4492,-5.461447,52.54653,4335,-5.466408,52.53665,4125,-5.473137,52.52334,3981,-5.477735,52.51422,3699,-5.486279,52.49626,3501,-5.491605,52.48355,3309,-5.496688,52.47122,3142,-5.501182,52.46043,2919,-5.507228,52.44619,2781,-5.510948,52.43734,2637,-5.514712,52.42809,2434,-5.519905,52.41499,2296,-5.52346,52.40615,2152,-5.527242,52.39693,1996,-5.531325,52.38697,1863,-5.534771,52.37853,1653,-5.540455,52.36514,1521,-5.544113,52.35672,1383,-5.547925,52.34792,1179,-5.55359,52.33484,1047,-5.557238,52.3264,910,-5.561023,52.31752,765,-5.565156,52.30827,609,-5.56969,52.29825,412,-5.57546,52.2856]},{"name":"SEATRUCK

PRESS ETNA","text":"X PRESS ETNA:Mount Etna (or Etna; pronunciation: /ˈɛtnə/; Italian: Etna [ˈɛtna] or Mongibello [mondʒiˈbɛllo], Sicilian: Mungibeddu [mʊndʒɪbˈbɛɖɖʊ] or â Muntagna, Latin: Aetna) is an active stratovolcano on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, in the Metropolitan City of Catania, between the cities of Messina and Catania. It lies above the convergent plate margin between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is the tallest active volcano in Europe,currently 3,329 m (10,922 ft) high, though this varies with summit eruptions. It is the highest peak in Italy south of the Alps. Etna covers an area of 1,190 km2 (459 sq mi) with a basal circumference of 140 km. This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius. Only Mount Teide in Tenerife (owned by Spain) surpasses it in the whole of the European–North-African region. In Greek Mythology, the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under this mountain by Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder and king of gods, and the forges of Hephaestus were said to also be located underneath it.Mount Etna is one of the most active volcanoes in the world and is in an almost constant state of activity. The fertile volcanic soils support extensive agriculture, with vineyards and orchards spread across the lower slopes of the mountain and the broad Plain of Catania to the south. Due to its history of recent activity and nearby population, Mount Etna has been designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations In June 2013, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Etymology: According to Adrian Room’s book Place-names of the World, the name Etna originated from the Phoenician word attuna meaning \"furnace\" or \"chimney\". He dismisses the hypothesis that Etna is from the Greek αἴθω (aithō), meaning \"I burn\", through an iotacist pronunciation.[8] In Classical Greek, it is called Αἴτνη (Aítnē),a name given also to Catania and the city originally known as Inessa, and in Latin it is called Aetna. In Arabic, it was called جبل النار Jabal al-Nār (the Mountain of Fire). It is also known as Mungibeddu in Sicilian and Mongibello or Montebello in Italian (The Italian word literally meaning Monte mountain and Bello meaning beautiful, but the Sicilian word is actually thought to be from the Latin mons and the Arabic جبل jabal, both meaning mountain, producing a tautological place name, \"mountain mountain\").[11] The term is not in common use today, although some older people still call it this. According to another hypothesis the term Mongibello comes from the Latin Mulciber (qui ignem mulcet, who placates the fire), one of the Latin names of the Roman god Vulcan. The people of the Etna sometimes use the jargon term 'a muntagna, simply \"the mountain\" par excellence.\nNowadays, the term Mongibello indicates the mountain's top area of the two central craters encompassing also the craters in the southeast and the northeast of the volcanic cone.","path":[82074,-6.210832,53.34362,80632,-6.210834,53.34367,79372,-6.210837,53.34361,78113,-6.210834,53.34367,76853,-6.210834,53.34367,75593,-6.21086,53.34361,74333,-6.21084,53.34361,72353,-6.210852,53.34362,70552,-6.210844,53.34361,69113,-6.210852,53.34361,67852,-6.210848,53.34363,66592,-6.210827,53.34362,64972,-6.210845,53.34362,63712,-6.21085,53.34362,62273,-6.210852,53.34363,60832,-6.210834,53.34367,59573,-6.210834,53.34367,58314,-6.210847,53.34363,56873,-6.210834,53.34367,55613,-6.210834,53.34367,54352,-6.210834,53.34367,53094,-6.210855,53.34366,52913,-6.210667,53.344,52553,-6.209167,53.3465,51832,-6.210263,53.34693,50572,-6.210333,53.347,49312,-6.210233,53.34695,47872,-6.210333,53.34683,46613,-6.210166,53.347,44994,-6.210252,53.34692,43733,-6.210248,53.34692,42473,-6.210255,53.34693,41213,-6.210333,53.347,39054,-6.210257,53.34693,37252,-6.210255,53.34693,35993,-6.210166,53.347,34734,-6.210255,53.34693,33472,-6.21026,53.34693,32212,-6.210333,53.34683,30953,-6.210262,53.34691,29513,-6.21027,53.34692,28252,-6.210333,53.347,26992,-6.210333,53.347,25733,-6.210333,53.347,24474,-6.210253,53.34695,23213,-6.210333,53.347,21953,-6.210247,53.34693,20693,-6.21024,53.34692,19433,-6.210265,53.34692,17994,-6.210262,53.34692,16732,-6.21026,53.34692,15473,-6.210333,53.347,14213,-6.210333,53.347,12952,-6.210333,53.347,11694,-6.21026,53.34694,10254,-6.210227,53.34691,10093,-6.210333,53.34667,9982,-6.210166,53.3465,9858,-6.21023,53.34601,9725,-6.21,53.34566,9612,-6.209495,53.34539,9492,-6.208776,53.34483,9301,-6.2045,53.34383,9181,-6.199333,53.34367,9042,-6.192333,53.34367,8902,-6.184077,53.34381,8782,-6.176579,53.34404,8652,-6.167705,53.34406,8516,-6.15699,53.34393,8318,-6.137671,53.34276,8186,-6.12277,53.34221,8060,-6.108501,53.34064,7926,-6.094203,53.33705,7801,-6.080628,53.33614,7680,-6.068045,53.33786,7540,-6.05467,53.34227,7389,-6.041538,53.34658,7240,-6.03089,53.35,7089,-6.023,53.3525,6957,-6.013834,53.35467,6783,-5.997167,53.35333,6651,-5.9855,53.34983,6499,-5.972648,53.34585,6360,-5.960853,53.34223,6219,-5.949,53.33867,6070,-5.936333,53.33484,5950,-5.925918,53.33171,5821,-5.915,53.3285,5680,-5.90312,53.32469,5530,-5.8905,53.32067,5380,-5.878082,53.31606,5229,-5.8655,53.3115,5080,-5.8532,53.30701,4890,-5.837477,53.30132,4760,-5.826667,53.29733,4600,-5.813167,53.2925,4460,-5.80155,53.28786,4320,-5.790167,53.28316,4200,-5.781,53.27867,3990,-5.764743,53.27077,3840,-5.753112,53.26519,3720,-5.743695,53.26077,3600,-5.734328,53.25624,3410,-5.7195,53.24917,3269,-5.7085,53.24383,3140,-5.698431,53.23905,3006,-5.688334,53.23417,2883,-5.683,53.2275,2753,-5.6844,53.2198,2600,-5.693167,53.2125,2470,-5.701334,53.2065,2330,-5.71005,53.20021,2150,-5.721075,53.19191,1951,-5.7335,53.183,1820,-5.741667,53.17735,1686,-5.7465,53.1705,1560,-5.744493,53.16331,1420,-5.736,53.15667,1280,-5.727,53.15017,1160,-5.7195,53.1445,1040,-5.711833,53.13883,910,-5.703748,53.13271,790,-5.696301,53.12706,669,-5.689015,53.12135,549,-5.681803,53.11564,429,-5.674773,53.10991,300,-5.667117,53.10369,180,-5.660137,53.09778,50,-5.652833,53.09117]},{"name":"RNLI LIFEBOAT B-853","text":"RNLI LIFEBOAT The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is the largest charity that saves lives at sea around the coasts of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as well as on some inland waterways. There are numerous other lifeboat services operating in the same area.Founded in 1824 as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, the RNLI was granted Royal Charter in 1860 and is a charity in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Queen Elizabeth II is Patron. The RNLI is principally funded by legacies and donations with most lifeboat crew members being unpaid volunteers.The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and operates 444 lifeboats. Crews rescued on average 22 people a day in 2015. RNLI Lifeguards operate on more than 200 beaches. They are paid by local authorities, while the RNLI provides equipment and training. The Institution operates Flood Rescue Teams (FRT) nationally and internationally (iFRT), the latter prepared to travel to emergencies overseas at short notice.Considerable effort is put into training and education by the Institution, particularly for young people; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. The Institution has saved some 140,000 lives since its foundation, at a cost of more than 600 lives lost in service.\nSir William Hillary came to live on the Isle of Man in 1808. Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast, he drew up plans for a national lifeboat service manned by trained crews. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty. However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, with the help of Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert, the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824. At the age of 60, Sir William took part in the 1830 rescue of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. He commanded the lifeboat and was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. It was this incident which prompted Sir William to set up a scheme to build The Tower of Refuge on Conister Rock – a project completed in 1832 which stands to this day at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. In 1854 the institution's name changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (in 1849 Prince Albert had added his support to the Institution[1]) and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of the work of Sir William.1974 postage stamp marking the RNLI's 150th anniversary (rescue of Daunt Lightship's crew by Ballycotton lifeboat RNLB Mary Stanford. Artist: B. F. Gribble)\nIn its first year the RNLI raised £10,000, however by 1849, income had dropped to £354.[3] Finding itself in financial difficulties, the RNLI accepted a government subsidy of £2,000, which rose in subsequent years. This lasted until 1869, when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies; in addition, the government's imposition of bureaucracy and regulations were detrimental to the service.[4] It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new impetus to fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £10,000. The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year.","path":[70826,-9.04695,53.26918,70466,-9.047123,53.26916,69208,-9.046893,53.26912,69025,-9.046832,53.26913,68816,-9.046126,53.26867,68606,-9.0395,53.26241,68457,-9.042171,53.2518,68307,-9.067355,53.24687,68185,-9.077545,53.2545,68067,-9.079953,53.25584,67919,-9.081815,53.25459,67768,-9.073849,53.25108,67590,-9.060512,53.24821,67467,-9.044037,53.24973,67258,-9.037403,53.25106,67051,-9.037579,53.25057,66867,-9.041717,53.24905,66717,-9.042155,53.24904,66508,-9.03724,53.2496,66358,-9.038502,53.25053,66118,-9.039422,53.25097,65967,-9.035024,53.25266,65848,-9.034495,53.25293,65639,-9.034387,53.25413,65462,-9.033495,53.25526,65219,-9.035757,53.25866,65069,-9.046806,53.26902,64776,-9.047245,53.26892]},{"name":"AVALON","text":"AVALON:Avalon (/ˈævəˌlɒn/; Latin: Insula Avallonis, Old French Avalon, Welsh: Ynys Afallon, Ynys Afallach; literally meaning \"the isle of fruit [or apple] trees\") is a legendary island featured in the Arthurian legend. It first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's 1136 pseudo-historical account Historia Regum Britanniae (\"The History of the Kings of Britain\") as the place where King Arthur's sword Excalibur was forged and later where Arthur was taken to recover from his wounds after the Battle of Camlann. Avalon was associated from an early date with mystical practices and people such as Morgan le Fay.Geoffrey of Monmouth referred to it in Latin as Insula Avallonis in the Historia. In the later Vita Merlini he called it Insula Pomorum the \"isle of fruit trees\" (from Latin pōmus \"fruit tree\"). The name is generally considered to be of Welsh origin (though an Old Cornish or Old Breton origin is also possible), derived from Old Welsh, Old Cornish, or Old Breton aball or avallen(n), \"apple tree, fruit tree\" (cf. afall in Modern Welsh, derived from Common Celtic *abalnā).[1][2][3][4][5] It is also possible that the tradition of an \"apple\" island among the British was influenced by Irish legends concerning the otherworld island home of Manannán mac Lir and Lugh, Emain Ablach (also the Old Irish poetic name for the Isle of Man),[2] where Ablach means \"Having Apple Trees\"[6] – derived from Old Irish aball (\"apple\")—and is similar to the Middle Welsh name Afallach, which was used to replace the name Avalon in medieval Welsh translations of French and Latin Arthurian tales. All are etymologically related to the Gaulish root *aballo- (as found in the place name Aballo/Aballone, now Avallon in Burgundy or in the Italian surname Avallone) and are derived from a Common Celtic *abal- \"apple\", which is related at the Proto-Indo-European level to English apple, Russian яблоко (jabloko), Latvian ābele, et al.[7][8]According to Geoffrey in the Historia and much subsequent literature which he inspired, Avalon is the place where King Arthur is taken after fighting Mordred at the Battle of Camlann to recover from his wounds. Welsh, Cornish and Breton tradition claimed that Arthur had never really died, but would inexorably return to lead his people against their enemies. The Historia also states that Avalon is where his sword Excalibur was forged. Geoffrey dealt with Avalon in more detail in Vita Merlini, in which he describes for the first time in Arthurian legend the enchantress Morgan le Fay as the chief of nine sisters (Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, Thiten and Thiton)[9] who live on Avalon. Geoffrey's description of the island indicates a sea voyage was needed to get there. His description of Avalon here, which is heavily indebted to the early medieval Spanish scholar Isidore of Seville (being mostly derived from the section on famous islands in Isidore's famous work Etymologiae, XIV.6.8 \"Fortunatae Insulae\"), shows the magical nature of the island:By comparison, Isidore's description of the Fortunate Isles reads:In medieval geographies, Isidore's Fortunate Islands were identified with the Canaries.[12][13][14][15]Around 1190, Avalon became associated with Glastonbury, when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have discovered the bones of Arthur and his queen. The works of Gerald of Wales make the first known connection:Though no longer an island in the twelfth century, the high conical bulk of Glastonbury Tor had been surrounded by marsh before the surrounding fenland in the Somerset Levels was drained. In ancient times, Ponter's Ball Dyke would have guarded the only entrance to the island. The Romans eventually built another road to the island.[17] Gerald wrote that Glastonbury's earliest name in Welsh was Ineswitrin (or Ynys Witrin), the Isle of glass, a name noted by earlier historians which suggests that the location was at one point seen as an island. The discovery of the burial is described by chroniclers, notably Gerald of Wales, as being just after King Henry II's reign when the new abbot of Glastonbury, Henry de Sully, commissioned a search of the abbey grounds. At a depth of 5 m (16 feet) the monks were said to have discovered a massive treetrunk coffin and a leaden cross bearing the inscription:Accounts of the exact inscription vary, with five different versions existing. The earliest is by Gerald in \"Liber de Principis instructione\" c. 1193, who wrote that he viewed the cross in person and traced the lettering. His transcript reads: \"Here lies buried the famous King Arthur (\"Arthurus\") with Guinevere (\"Wenneveria\") his second wife in the isle of Avalon\". Inside the coffin were two bodies, who Giraldus refers to as Arthur and \"his queen\"; the bones of the male body were described as being gigantic. The account of the burial by the chronicle of Margam Abbey says three bodies were found, the other being of Mordred.[18] In 1278, the remains were reburied with great ceremony, attended by King Edward I and his queen, before the High Altar at Glastonbury Abbey, where they were the focus of pilgrimages until the Reformation.The story is today seen as an example of pseudoarchaeology. Historians today generally dismiss the authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184.[19] Long before this William of Malmesbury, a historian interested in Arthur, said in his history of England \"But Arthur’s grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return.\"[20] As William wrote a comprehensive history of Glastonbury De antiquitae Glatoniensis ecclesie around 1130 which discussed many pious legends connected to the Abbey, but made no mention of either Arthur's grave or a connection of Glastonbury to the name Avalon, stating firmly it was previously known as Ineswitrin, this raises further suspicions concerning the burial. It is known for certain the monks later added forged passages to William's history discussing Arthurian connections.[21] The fact that the search for the body is connected to Henry II and Edward I, both kings who fought major Welsh wars, has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well.[22] Gerald, a constant supporter of royal authority, in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of King's Arthur's messianic return: \"Many tales are told and many legends have been invented about King Arthur and his mysterious ending. In their stupidity the British [i.e. Welsh, Cornish and Bretons] people maintain that he is still alive. Now that the truth is known, I have taken the trouble to add a few more details in this present chapter. The fairy-tales have been snuffed out, and the true and indubitable facts are made known, so that what really happened must be made crystal clear to all and separated from the myths which have accumulated on the subject.\"[23]The burial discovery ensured that in later romances, histories based on them and in the popular imagination Glastonbury became increasingly identified with Avalon, an identification that continues strongly today. The later development of the legends of the Holy Grail and Joseph of Arimathea by Robert de Boron interconnected these legends with Glastonbury and with Avalon, an identification which also seems to be made in Perlesvaus. The popularity of Arthurian Romance has meant this area of the Somerset Levels has today become popularly described as The Vale of Avalon.[24] In more recent times writers such as Dion Fortune, John Michell, Nicholas Mann and Geoffrey Ashe have formed theories based on perceived connections between Glastonbury and Celtic legends of the otherworld and Annwn in attempts to link the location firmly with Avalon, drawing on the various legends based on Glastonbury Tor as well as drawing on ideas like Earth mysteries, Ley lines and even the myth of Atlantis. Arthurian literature also continues to use Glastonbury as an important location as in The Mists of Avalon, A Glastonbury Romance and The Bones of Avalon. Even the fact that Somerset has many apple orchards has been drawn in to support the connection. Glastonbury's connection to Avalon continues to make it a site of tourism and the area has great religious significance for Neopagans, Neo-druids and as a New Age community, as well as Christians. Hippy identification of Glastonbury with Avalon seen in the work of Michell and in Gandalf's Garden also helped inspire the Glastonbury Festival.[25]In medieval times suggestions for the location of Avalon ranged far beyond Glastonbury. They included on the other side of the Earth at the antipodes, Sicily, and other unnamed locations in the Mediterranean.[26]In more recent times, just like in the quest for Arthur's mythical capital Camelot, a large number of locations have been put forward as being the real \"Avalon\". Geoffrey Ashe suggests an association of Avalon with the town of Avallon in Burgundy, as part of a theory connecting King Arthur to the Romano-British leader Riothamus who campaigned in that area.[27]","path":[81851,-9.049223,53.27002,80591,-9.049225,53.27003,79331,-9.049243,53.27001,78071,-9.049235,53.27001,76811,-9.049245,53.27002,75551,-9.049243,53.27001,74291,-9.049232,53.27003,73031,-9.049249,53.27002,71591,-9.04923,53.27002,69791,-9.04925,53.27001,68531,-9.049243,53.27003,67271,-9.04926,53.27001,66011,-9.049258,53.26999,64751,-9.049236,53.27002,63491,-9.049243,53.27001,62231,-9.049253,53.27,60971,-9.049216,53.27,59711,-9.049235,53.27001,58451,-9.049233,53.27,57191,-9.049252,53.26999,55751,-9.049243,53.27002,54491,-9.049258,53.27,53231,-9.049265,53.27004,51791,-9.049207,53.27,50531,-9.049236,53.27,49271,-9.049225,53.26999,48011,-9.049213,53.26999,46751,-9.049233,53.27,45491,-9.049227,53.27,44231,-9.04924,53.27001,42971,-9.049225,53.27003,41711,-9.049252,53.27004,40451,-9.049238,53.27002,39191,-9.049232,53.27001,37931,-9.049229,53.27002,36671,-9.049222,53.27003,35411,-9.04923,53.27001,34175,-9.050007,53.27013,33895,-9.050709,53.26998,33744,-9.050457,53.2701,33612,-9.049896,53.27003,33364,-9.048748,53.26951,33095,-9.046008,53.26775,32965,-9.044805,53.26652,32744,-9.041377,53.26392,32606,-9.038604,53.26174,32463,-9.036306,53.25937,32335,-9.037438,53.25646,32145,-9.040577,53.25197,31954,-9.04719,53.24879,31816,-9.052275,53.24675,31685,-9.056437,53.24515,31565,-9.059658,53.24398,31433,-9.063962,53.24229,31235,-9.073605,53.23726,31109,-9.07375,53.23473,30109,-9.0735,53.23499,28848,-9.073443,53.23499,28847,-9.073443,53.23499,27588,-9.073475,53.23505,26327,-9.073553,53.235,25068,-9.073602,53.23509,23808,-9.073578,53.23504,22548,-9.073578,53.23505,21288,-9.07361,53.23512,21287,-9.07361,53.23512,20028,-9.07361,53.2351,18768,-9.073624,53.2351,17508,-9.073702,53.23515,16248,-9.073758,53.2352,14988,-9.073771,53.23522,13728,-9.073809,53.23521,12468,-9.073905,53.23528,11208,-9.07354,53.23496,9948,-9.073465,53.23483,8688,-9.073564,53.23497,7428,-9.074045,53.23521,6168,-9.073894,53.23522,4908,-9.073695,53.23438,3648,-9.07424,53.23417,2387,-9.073763,53.23434,1127,-9.073512,53.23466]},{"name":"GALWAY PILOT VESSEL","text":"GALWAY PILOT VESSEL:The page \"GALWAY PILOT VESSEL\" does not exist. The Galway hooker (Irish: húicéir) is a traditional fishing boat used in Galway Bay off the west coast of Ireland. The hooker was developed for the strong seas there. It is identified by its sharp, clean entry, bluff bow, marked tumblehome and raked transom. Its sail plan consists of a single mast with a main sail and two foresails. Traditionally, the boat is black (being coated in pitch) and the sails are a dark red-brown.Recently there has been a major revival, and renewed interest in the Galway hooker, and the boats are still being painstakingly constructed. The festival of Cruinniú na mBád is held each year, when boats race across Galway Bay from Connemara to Kinvara on the Galway/Clare county boundary.Classes of Galway Hooker: Galway hooker under sail at Belfast Titanic Maritime Festival, Queen's Quay, Belfast, Northern Ireland, June 2010. The hooker refers to four classes of boats. All are named in Irish. The Bád Mór (big boats) ranges in length from 10.5 to 13.5 metres (35 to 44 feet). The smaller Leathbhád (half boat) is about 10 metres (28 feet) in length. Both the Bád Mór and Leathbhád were decked forward of the mast. These boats were used to carry turf to be used as fuel across Galway Bay from Connemara and County Mayo to the Aran Islands and the Burren. The boats often brought limestone on the return journeys, to neutralise the acid soils of Connemara and Mayo. The Gleoiteog ranges in length from 7 to 9 metres (24 to 28 feet) and has the same sails and rigging as the larger boats. They were used for fishing and carrying cargo. Another boat, the Púcán, is similar in size to the Gleoiteog but has a lug mainsail and a foresail. These smaller boats were entirely open.There was also a class fitted with a cockpit floor over the ballast used for fishing. When the Irish settlers at Boston USA needed fishing craft, they built the hooker that they knew from home. These boats became known as Boston Hookers, Irish Cutters in official reports, or Paddy Boats.While a very utilitarian boat, well suited for the shallow waters of Galway Bay and being capable of being beached where necessary, the Galway Hooker is prone to being swamped and sinking in a short time in the absence of a cabin and high freeboard. Eighty-two shipwrecks are recorded in the unpublished Shipwreck Inventory of Wrecks for Galway Bay. These eighty-two wrecks date to between 1750 and 1938 and of these, 59, are from the 19th century. No records currently exists for the period prior to the 18th century. Cargo throughout this period would usually be held in wooden casks varnished with fish oil for waterproofing.","path":[53992,-9.048054,53.26915,53752,-9.047852,53.26929,41561,-9.047853,53.26931,40301,-9.047985,53.26917,39040,-9.047998,53.26924,38908,-9.047783,53.26892,37649,-9.047789,53.26891,36330,-9.047883,53.26929,34250,-9.047894,53.26933,34100,-9.050529,53.26997,33986,-9.050682,53.27032,33853,-9.050756,53.27025,33792,-9.05064,53.27057,33712,-9.05064,53.27057,33552,-9.050814,53.27042,33433,-9.050755,53.2704,33233,-9.048993,53.26944,32834,-9.048489,53.26869,32684,-9.047105,53.26833,32473,-9.043732,53.26511,32298,-9.039815,53.26106,32084,-9.040272,53.2552,31935,-9.04179,53.25257,31814,-9.04697,53.25039,31605,-9.057055,53.24588,31365,-9.061387,53.2441,31216,-9.054111,53.24701,31066,-9.048088,53.25031,31065,-9.048088,53.25031,30825,-9.039786,53.25746,30644,-9.042202,53.26423,30495,-9.047611,53.2688,30385,-9.047905,53.26929,29999,-9.048083,53.26921,29714,-9.04792,53.26929,28135,-9.047875,53.26927,26903,-9.04793,53.2693,26824,-9.04793,53.2693]},{"name":"SKIPPER","text":"SKIPPER:Skipper or skippers may refer to:A skipper is a person who has command of a boat or sea-craft or tug, more or less equivalent to \"captain in charge aboard ship.\" At sea, or upon lakes and rivers, the skipper as shipmaster or captain has command over the whole crew. The skipper may or may not be the owner of the boat.The word is derived from the Dutch word schipper; schip is Dutch for \"ship\". In Dutch sch- is pronounced [sx] and English-speakers rendered this as [sk]. The word \"skipper\" is used more than \"captain\" for some types of craft, for example fishing boats.It is also more frequently used than captain with privately owned noncommercial or semi-commercial vessels, such as small yachts and other recreational boats, mostly in cases where the person in command of the boat may not be a licensed or professional captain, suggesting the term is less formal. In the U.S., a \"skipper\" who is in command of a charter vessel that carries paying passengers must be licensed by a state or the USCG. If the vessel carries over six paying passengers, it must be an \"inspected vessel\" and a higher class license must be obtained by the skipper/master depending on the vessel's gross tons.In the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and merchant naval slang, it is a term used in reference to the commanding officer of any ship, base, or other command regardless of rank. It is generally only applied to someone who has earned the speaker's respect, and only used with the permission of the commander/commanding officer in question.Skipper RNR was an actual rank used in the British Royal Naval Reserve for skippers of fishing boats who were members of the service. It was equivalent to Warrant Officer. Skippers could also be promoted to Chief Skipper RNR (equivalent to Commissioned Warrant Officer) and Skipper Lieutenant RNR.\n\n","path":[39283,-9.05085,53.27047,37933,-9.05085,53.27047,36583,-9.050867,53.27045,35312,-9.050867,53.27045,33972,-9.05085,53.27045,32553,-9.050867,53.27045,31283,-9.05085,53.27043,31142,-9.0508,53.27045,30923,-9.047767,53.26895,30703,-9.044117,53.26632,30554,-9.041717,53.26467,30392,-9.03935,53.2628,30152,-9.03725,53.2598,30023,-9.03665,53.25805,29842,-9.036917,53.25523,29716,-9.038466,53.25297,29582,-9.042,53.25125,29443,-9.045816,53.24958,29304,-9.049983,53.24815,29172,-9.053917,53.2469,29043,-9.057783,53.24558,28912,-9.061584,53.24435,28762,-9.065917,53.2429,28641,-9.069266,53.24168,28502,-9.07325,53.24028,28373,-9.076983,53.23898,28183,-9.0816,53.23722,28042,-9.084784,53.23567,27869,-9.087684,53.23355,27721,-9.088217,53.23337,27573,-9.08885,53.23342,27381,-9.089817,53.23347,27151,-9.090883,53.23352,26912,-9.091784,53.23355,26692,-9.092716,53.23357,26453,-9.093516,53.23355,26216,-9.094267,53.23318,25972,-9.097867,53.23215,25732,-9.1028,53.23113,25471,-9.108133,53.23018,25291,-9.11175,53.22952,25161,-9.114367,53.22906,25031,-9.117017,53.22861,24822,-9.121166,53.22782,24582,-9.1259,53.22692,24432,-9.128866,53.22632,24312,-9.131166,53.22583,24112,-9.135067,53.22488,23882,-9.1397,53.22393,23762,-9.142183,53.2235,23651,-9.144433,53.2231,23532,-9.1469,53.22273,23413,-9.149283,53.22227,23302,-9.151533,53.22192,23122,-9.15555,53.22122,22993,-9.158633,53.22072,22862,-9.161716,53.22015,22733,-9.1648,53.21962,22543,-9.169367,53.21887,22352,-9.1739,53.21808,22223,-9.177033,53.21758,22093,-9.180567,53.21707,21942,-9.184733,53.21646,21760,-9.189716,53.21572,21622,-9.193583,53.21522,21493,-9.19715,53.2147,21371,-9.200483,53.21423,21241,-9.204083,53.21372,21092,-9.20825,53.2131,20954,-9.21215,53.21258,20822,-9.21585,53.21205,20701,-9.219234,53.21157,20571,-9.22285,53.21105,20383,-9.2281,53.21025,20191,-9.233533,53.20955,20064,-9.237683,53.20895,19942,-9.242117,53.20833,19813,-9.247167,53.20763,19684,-9.252483,53.20688,19554,-9.257816,53.20615,19362,-9.26565,53.20502,19213,-9.271667,53.20405,19073,-9.277384,53.20327,18880,-9.285116,53.20207,18732,-9.29115,53.20152,18523,-9.299583,53.20073,18383,-9.30525,53.20025,18251,-9.31045,53.19975,18124,-9.315583,53.19933,18002,-9.320933,53.19883,17811,-9.3296,53.19857,17621,-9.338284,53.19827,17464,-9.341866,53.1982,17292,-9.353316,53.19785,17104,-9.358267,53.19777,16892,-9.371417,53.19743,16812,-9.371417,53.19743,16683,-9.380783,53.19727,16533,-9.387484,53.19728,16440,-9.39155,53.19732,16361,-9.39155,53.19732,15683,-9.421583,53.19717,12851,-9.548767,53.19773,12731,-9.55385,53.19812,12432,-9.566533,53.199,10851,-9.632983,53.2029,9352,-9.695,53.20012,9022,-9.7083,53.199,8431,-9.732017,53.1968,8251,-9.739217,53.19613,8111,-9.74485,53.19557,7981,-9.7501,53.19503,7831,-9.7562,53.19445,7682,-9.76235,53.19383,7532,-9.768917,53.19333,7372,-9.775983,53.1927,7212,-9.783267,53.1922,6992,-9.79325,53.19158,6851,-9.7996,53.19123,6632,-9.8094,53.19065,6492,-9.81535,53.18955,6352,-9.8213,53.18845,6203,-9.8275,53.18718,6062,-9.833366,53.18604,5911,-9.8396,53.18478,5762,-9.8457,53.18345,5552,-9.854183,53.18158,5402,-9.86025,53.18027,5192,-9.86865,53.17838,5042,-9.87465,53.17703,4891,-9.880716,53.1757,4751,-9.886333,53.17442,4621,-9.8915,53.17318,4471,-9.897367,53.17183,4312,-9.9036,53.1704,4152,-9.909883,53.16897,3992,-9.916083,53.16751,3851,-9.9216,53.1663,3702,-9.927383,53.16497,3541,-9.9336,53.16352,3391,-9.9394,53.16217,3251,-9.944817,53.16093,3102,-9.950767,53.1598,2962,-9.95635,53.15875,2811,-9.96245,53.15762,2652,-9.968817,53.15642,2492,-9.975217,53.15515,2352,-9.980766,53.15396,2212,-9.98615,53.15282,2062,-9.991867,53.15158,1921,-9.997283,53.1504,1711,-10.00532,53.14867,1571,-10.01063,53.1474,1430,-10.01603,53.14615,1282,-10.02175,53.14482,1141,-10.02715,53.14355,992,-10.033,53.14228,851,-10.03858,53.14107,702,-10.0444,53.1398,561,-10.04997,53.13868,412,-10.05587,53.13743,252,-10.06213,53.13612,32,-10.07078,53.13438]},{"name":"CARMAROSE","text":"CARMAROSE:Viscount Camrose, of Hackwood Park in the County of Southampton, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

He had already been created a Baronet, of Hackwood Park in the County of Southampton, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom, on 4 July 1921, and Baron Camrose, of Long Cross in the County of Surrey, on 19 June 1929, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His second son, the third Viscount, disclaimed the peerages in 1995 on succeeding his elder brother. However, he had already been created a life peer as Baron Hartwell, of Peterborough Court in the City of London, in 1968. On his death in 2001 the life peerage became extinct while he was succeeded in the other titles by his eldest son, the fourth Viscount. The first three Viscounts all headed The Daily Telegraph at one point, the first having purchased it from Harry Levy-Lawson, 1st Viscount Burnham, but in the 1980s they lost control to Conrad Black. The first Viscount was the younger brother of the industrialist Henry Berry, 1st Baron Buckland, and the elder brother of fellow press lord Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount

Columba (Irish: Colm Cille, 'church dove';[a][1][2] 7 December 521 – 9 June 597) was an Irish abbot and missionary credited with spreading Christianity in what is today Scotland at the start of the Hiberno-Scottish mission. He founded the important abbey on Iona, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of Derry. He was highly regarded by both the Gaels of Dál Riata and the Picts, and is remembered today as a Christian saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland.[3]Columba studied under some of Ireland's most prominent church figures and founded several monasteries in the country. Around 563 he and his twelve companions crossed to Dunaverty near Southend, Argyll in Kintyre before settling in Iona in Scotland, then part of the Ulster kingdom of Dál Riata, where they founded a new abbey as a base for spreading Christianity among the northern Pictish kingdoms[4][5] who were pagan. He remained active in Irish politics, though he spent most of the remainder of his life in Scotland. Three surviving early medieval Latin hymns may be attributed to him.[6]Columba was born to Fedlimid and Eithne of the Cenel Conaill in Gartan, near Lough Gartan, in modern County Donegal, in Ireland. On his father's side, he was great-great-grandson of Niall of the Nine Hostages, an Irish high king of the 5th century. He was baptised in Temple-Douglas, in the County Donegal parish of Conwal (midway between Gartan and Letterkenny), by his teacher and foster-uncle Saint Crunathan.[7][8][9] It is not known for sure if his name at birth was Columba or if he adopted this name later in life; Adomnan of Iona thought it was his birth name but other Irish sources have claimed his name at birth was Crimthann (meaning 'fox').[10] In the Irish language his name means 'dove', which is the same name as the Prophet Jonah (Jonah in Hebrew is also 'dove'), which Adomnan of Iona as well as other early Irish writers were aware of,[10] although it is not clear if he was deliberately named after Jonah or not.When sufficiently advanced in letters he entered the monastic school of Movilla, at Newtownards, under St. Finnian who had studied at St. Ninian's \"Magnum Monasterium\" on the shores of Galloway. He was about twenty, and a deacon when, having completed his training at Movilla, he travelled southwards into Leinster, where he became a pupil of an aged bard named Gemman. On leaving him, Columba entered the monastery of Clonard, governed at that time by Finnian, noted for sanctity and learning. Here he imbibed the traditions of the Welsh Church, for Finnian had been trained in the schools of St. David.[11]In early Christian Ireland the druidic tradition collapsed due to the spread of the new Christian faith. The study of Latin learning and Christian theology in monasteries flourished. Columba became a pupil at the monastic school at Clonard Abbey, situated on the River Boyne in modern County Meath. During the sixth century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish Christianity studied at the Clonard monastery. It is said that the average number of scholars under instruction at Clonard was 3,000.[3] Columba was one of twelve students of St. Finnian who became known as the Twelve Apostles of Ireland. He became a monk and eventually was ordained a priest.Another preceptor of Columba was St. Mobhi, whose monastery at Glasnevin was frequented by such famous men as St. Canice, St. Comgall, and St. Ciaran. A pestilence which devastated Ireland in 544 caused the dispersion of Mobhi's disciples, and Columba returned to Ulster, the land of his kindred. He was a striking figure of great stature and powerful build, with a loud, melodious voice which could be heard from one hilltop to another.[12] The following years were marked by the foundation of several important monasteries, Derry, County Londonderry; Durrow, County Offaly; Kells, County Meath; and Swords.[13] While at Derry it is said that he planned a pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem, but did not proceed farther than Tours. Thence he brought a copy of those gospels that had lain on the bosom of St. Martin for the space of 100 years. This relic was deposited in Derry.[11]Tradition asserts that, sometime around 560, he became involved in a quarrel with Saint Finnian of Movilla Abbey over a psalter. Columba copied the manuscript at the scriptorium under Saint Finnian, intending to keep the copy. Saint Finnian disputed his right to keep the copy. The dispute eventually led to the pitched Battle of Cúl Dreimhne in Cairbre Drom Cliabh (now in County Sligo) in 561, during which many men were killed. A second grievance that led him to induce the clan Neill to rise and engage in battle against King Diarmait at Cooldrevny in 561 was the king's violation of the right of sanctuary belonging to Columba's person as a monk on the occasion of the murder of Prince Curnan, the saint's kinsman.[11] Prince Curnan of Connaught, who had fatally injured a rival in a hurling match and had taken refuge with Columba, was dragged from his protector's arms and slain by Diarmaid's men, in defiance of the rights of sanctuary.[12]A synod of clerics and scholars threatened to excommunicate him for these deaths, but St. Brendan of Birr spoke on his behalf with the result that he was allowed to go into exile instead. Columba's own conscience was uneasy, and on the advice of an aged hermit, Molaise, he resolved to expiate his offence by going into exile and win for Christ as many souls as had perished in the terrible battle of Cúl Dreimhne. He left Ireland, to return only once, many years later. Columba's copy of the psalter has been traditionally associated with the Cathach of St. Columba.In 563, he travelled to Scotland with twelve companions (said to include Odran of Iona) in a wicker currach covered with leather. According to legend he first landed on the Kintyre Peninsula, near Southend. However, being still in sight of his native land, he moved farther north up the west coast of Scotland. The island of Iona was made over to him by his kinsman Conall mac Comgaill King of Dál Riata, who perhaps had invited him to come to Scotland in the first place.[12] However, there is a sense in which he was not leaving his native people, as the Ulster Gaels had been colonising the west coast of Scotland for the previous couple of centuries.[14] Aside from the services he provided guiding the only centre of literacy in the region, his reputation as a holy man led to his role as a diplomat among the tribes.[15] There are also many stories of miracles which he performed during his work to convert the Picts, the most famous being his encounter with an unidentified animal that some have equated with the Loch Ness Monster in 565. It is said that he banished a ferocious \"water beast\" to the depths of the River Ness after it had killed a Pict and then tried to attack Columba's disciple (see Vita Columbae Book 2 below). He visited the pagan King Bridei, King of Fortriu, at his base in Inverness, winning Bridei's respect, although not his conversion. He subsequently played a major role in the politics of the country. He was also very energetic in his work as a missionary, and, in addition to founding several churches in the Hebrides, he worked to turn his monastery at Iona into a school for missionaries. He was a renowned man of letters, having written several hymns and being credited with having transcribed 300 books. One of the few, if not the only, times he left Scotland was towards the end of his life, when he returned to Ireland to found the monastery at Durrow.Columba died on Iona and was buried in 597 by his monks in the abbey he created. In 794 the Vikings descended on Iona. Columba's relics were finally removed in 849 and divided between Scotland and Ireland.[16] The parts of the relics which went to Ireland are reputed to be buried in Downpatrick, County Down, with St. Patrick and St. Brigid or at Saul Church neighbouring Downpatrick. (Names of Iona), Inchcolm and Eilean Chaluim Chille.Saint Columba is one of the three chief saints of Ireland, after saint Patrick and saint Brigit of Kildare. Columba is the patron-saint of the city of Derry, where he founded a monastic settlement in c. 540. The name of the city in Irish is Doire Colmcille and is derived from the native oak trees in the area and the city's association with Columba. The Catholic Church of Saint Columba's Long Tower, and the Church of Ireland St Augustine's Church both claim to stand at the spot of this original settlement. The Church of Ireland Cathedral in Derry is dedicated to St Columba. St. Colmcilles Primary School[17] and St. Colmcilles Community School[18] are two schools in Knocklyon, Dublin, named after St. Colmcille, with the former having an annual day dedicated to the saint on 9 June. The Columba Press, a religious and spiritual book company based in Dublin, is named after St. Columba. Aer Lingus, Ireland's national flag carrier has named one of its Airbus A330 aircraft in commemoration of the saint (reg: EI-DUO).Columba is credited as being a leading figure in the revitalisation of monasticism. The Clan Malcom/Clan McCallum claims its name from Columba and was reputedly founded by the descendants of his original followers. It is also said that Clan Robertson are heirs of Columba. Clan MacKinnon may also have some claim to being spiritual descendants of St Columcille as after he founded his monastery on Isle Iona, the MacKinnons were the abbots of the Church for centuries. This would also account for the fact that Clan MacKinnon is amongst the ancient clans of Scotland.[19]The cathedral of the Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles is placed under the patronage of St. Columba, as are numerous Catholic schools and parishes throughout the nation. The Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church of Scotland, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of England also have parishes dedicated to him. The village of Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire is also derived from Columba's name.Saint Columba currently has two poems attributed to him: \"Adiutor Laborantium\" and \"Altus Prosator\".[20] Both poems are examples of Abecedarian hymns in Latin written while Columba was at the Iona Abbey.The shorter of the two poems, \"Adiutor Laborantium\" consists of twenty-seven lines of eight syllables each, with each line following the format of an Abecedarian hymn using the Classical Latin alphabet save for lines 10-11 and 25-27. The content of the poem addresses God as a helper, ruler, guard, defender and lifter for those who are good and an enemy of sinners whom he will punish.[21]\"Altus Prosator\" consists of twenty-three stanzas sixteen syllables long, with the first containing seven lines and six lines in each subsequent stanza. It uses the same format and alphabet as \"Adiutor Laborantium\" except with each stanza starting with a different letter rather than each line. The poem tells a story over three parts split into the beginning of time, history of Creation, and the Apocalypse or end of time.[22]As of 2011, Canadians who are of Scottish ancestry are the third largest ethnic group in the country and thus Columba's name is to be found attached to Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian parishes. This is particularly the case in eastern Canada apart from Quebec which is French-speaking.Throughout the US there are numerous parishes within the Catholic and Episcopalian denominations dedicated to Columba. Within the Protestant tradition the Presbyterian Church (which has its roots in Scottish Presbyterianism) also has parishes named in honour of Columba. There is even an Orthodox Church monastery dedicated to the saint in the Massachusetts town of Southbridge. St. Columba is the Patron Saint of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown, OH. The Cathedral there is named for him.Iona College, a small Catholic liberal arts college in New Rochelle, NY, is named after the island on which Columba established his first monastery in Scotland, as is Iona College in Windsor, Ontario and Iona Presentation College, Perth.There are at least four pipe bands named for him; one each from Tullamore, Ireland,[23] from Derry, Northern Ireland,[24] from Kearny, New Jersey,[25] and from Cape Cod, Massachusetts.[26]St. Columba's School one of the most prominent English-Medium schools in Delhi run by the Irish Christian Brothers is also named after the Saint.The Munich GAA is named München Colmcilles.[27]St. Columba's Feast Day, 9 June, has been designated as International Celtic Art Day. The Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow, great medieval masterpieces of Celtic art, are associated with Columba. [28]The main source of information about Saint Columba's life is the Vita Columbae (i.e. \"Life of Columba\"), a hagiography written in the style of \"saint's lives\" narratives that had become widespread throughout medieval Europe. Compiled and drafted by scribes and clergymen, these accounts were written in Latin and served as written collections of the deeds and miracles attributed to the saint, both during his or her life or after death. The canonization of a saint, especially one who had lived on the fringes of the medieval Christian world like Saint Columba, required a well-written hagiography to be submitted to Rome, but popular belief and local cults of sainthood often led to the veneration of these men and women without official approval from the Catholic Church.Writing a century after the death of Saint Columba, the author Adomnán (also known as Eunan), served as the ninth Abbot of Iona until his death in 704 A.D.[29]James Earle Fraser asserts that Adomnán drew extensively from an existing body of accounts regarding the life of Saint Columba, including a Latin collection entitled \"De uirtutibus sancti Columbae\", composed c. 640 A.D. This earlier work is attributed to Cummene Find, who became the abbot of Iona and served as the leader of the monastic island community from 656 until his death in 668 A.D. or 669 A.D.[30]While the Vita Columbae often conflicts with contemporaneous accounts of various battles, figures, and dates, it remains the most important surviving work from early medieval Scotland and provides a wealth of knowledge regarding the Picts and other ethnic and political groups from this time period. The Vita also offers a valuable insight into the monastic practices of Iona and the daily life of the early medieval Gaelic monks.The surviving manuscripts include:Instead of relying on chronological order, Adomnán categorises the events recorded in the Vita Columbae into three different books: Columba’s Prophecies, Columba’s Miracles, and Columba’s Apparitions.[32]In the first book, the author Adomnán lists Saint Columba's prophetic revelations, which come as a result of the saint's ability to view the present and the future simultaneously. Most of the short chapters begin with Saint Columba informing his fellow monks that a person will soon arrive on the island or an event will imminently occur.In one notable instance, Columba appears in a dream to King Oswald of Northumbria, and announces the king's incoming victory against the King Catlon (Cadwallon of Wales) in the Battle of Heavenfield. The people of Britain promise to convert to Christianity and receive baptism after the conclusion of the war. This victory signals the re-Christianization of pagan England, and establishes King Oswald as ruler of the entirety of Britain.Columba's other prophecies can be considered vindictive at times, as when he sends a man named Batain off to perform his penance, but then Columba turns to his friends and says Batain will instead return to Scotia and be killed by his enemies. Several of Saint Columba's prophecies reflect the scribal culture in which he was immersed, such his miraculous knowledge of the missing letter \"I” from Baithene's psalter or when he prophecies that an eager man will knock over his inkhorn and spill its contents.[33]In the second book, Columba performs various miracles such as healing people with diseases, expelling malignant spirits, subduing wild beasts, calming storms, and even returning the dead to life. They have also made many schools in honour of St.Columba, one was founded by the Sisters of Charity.He also performs agricultural miracles that would hold a special significance to the common people of Ireland and the British Isles, such as when he casts a demon out of a pail and restores the spilt milk to its container.The Vita contains a story that has been interpreted as the first reference to the Loch Ness Monster. According to Adomnán, Columba came across a group of Picts burying a man who had been killed by the monster. Columba saves a swimmer from the monster with the sign of the Cross and the imprecation, \"Thou shalt go no further, nor touch the man; go back with all speed.\" The beast flees, terrified, to the amazement of the assembled Picts who glorified Columba's God. Whether or not this incident is true, Adomnan's text specifically states that the monster was swimming in the River Ness – the river flowing from the loch – rather than in Loch Ness itself.[34]In book three, Adomnán describes different apparitions of the Saint, both that Columba receives and those that are seen by others regarding him. He mentions that, \"For indeed after the lapse of many years, ... St. Columba was excommunicated by a certain synod for some pardonable and very trifling reasons, and indeed unjustly\" (P.79- 80).In one of the accounts, Saint Columba, in this period of excommunication, goes to a meeting held against him in Teilte. Saint Brendan, despite of all the negative reactions among the seniors toward Columba, kisses him reverently and assures that Columba is the man of God and that he sees Holy Angels accompanying Columba on his journey through the plain.[35]In the last Chapter, Columba foresees his own death when speaking to his attendant:This day in the Holy Scriptures is called the Sabbath, which means rest. And this day is indeed a Sabbath to me, for it is the last day of my present laborious life, and on it I rest after the fatigues of my labours; and this night at midnight, which commenceth the solemn Lord's Day, I shall, according to the sayings of Scripture, go the way of our fathers. For already my Lord Jesus Christ deigneth to invite me; and to Him, I say, in the middle of this night shall I depart, at His invitation. For so it hath been revealed to me by the Lord himself.And when the bell strikes midnight, Columba goes to the church and kneels beside the altar. His attendant witnesses heavenly light in the direction of Columba, and Holy angels join the saint in his passage to the Lord:And having given them his holy benediction in this way, he immediately breathed his last. After his soul had left the tabernacle of the body, his face still continued ruddy, and brightened in a wonderful way by his vision of the angels, and that to such a degree that he had the appearance, not so much of one dead, as of one alive and sleeping.[36]Both the Vita Columbae and the Venerable Bede (672/673-735) record Columba's visit to Bridei. Whereas Adomnán just tells us that Columba visited Bridei, Bede relates a later, perhaps Pictish tradition, whereby the saint actually converts the Pictish king. Another early source is a poem in praise of Columba, most probably commissioned by Columba's kinsman, the King of the Uí Néill clan. It was almost certainly written within three or four years of Columba's death and is the earliest vernacular poem in European history. It consists of 25 stanzas of four verses of seven syllables each.[citation needed]Through the reputation of its venerable founder and its position as a major European centre of learning, Columba's Iona became a place of pilgrimage. Columba is historically revered as a warrior saint, and was often invoked for victory in battle.[citation needed] His relics were finally removed in 849 and divided between Alba and Ireland. Relics of Columba were carried before Scottish armies in the reliquary made at Iona in the mid-8th century, called the Brecbennoch. Legend has it that the Brecbennoch was carried to the Battle of Bannockburn (24 June 1314) by the vastly outnumbered Scots army and the intercession of Columba helped them to victory. It is widely thought[by whom?] that the Monymusk Reliquary is the object in question.[citation needed]In the Antiphoner of Inchcolm Abbey, the \"Iona of the East\" (situated on an island in the Firth of Forth), a 13th-century prayer begins O Columba spes Scotorum... \"O Columba, hope of the Scots\".[citation

The town is situated at the head of a scenic harbour and at the base of a vast mountainous tract extending northward.[1] In the summer, there is a street festival celebrating the fish catches and incorporating the traditional \"Blessing of the Boats\". It has a population of 1,297.History: In 1588, Killybegs was the last port of call for the Spanish vessel La Girona, which had dropped anchor in the harbour when the Spanish Armada fetched up on the Irish coast during Spain's war with England. With the assistance of a Killybegs chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, the Girona's personnel were fed, her rudder repaired, and she set sail for Scotland, but was wrecked off the Antrim coast with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives.Fishing industry: Killybegs is a natural deepwater harbour with a depth of 12 meters at low water spring tide at the new €50 million pier completed in 2004. The harbour is home to all the largest Irish midwater pelagic trawlers, and a modest whitefish fleet, but it handles many other types of shipping as well. These include passenger cruise liners and mixed specialist cargoes. In recent years Killybegs has become the favoured port for the importation of wind turbines, and is a service port for the offshore gas/oil drilling rigs.The town is the centre of the Irish pelagic fishing and processing industries, as it specialises in the processing and freezing of species such as mackerel, herring, scad, and blue whiting. The finished processed fish is exported to markets in Africa, the Middle East and Europe by freezer ships. However, due to blanket enforcement of EU fishing regulations on Irish vessels by the Irish Department of the Marine, starting in 2005, and mackerel shoals remaining longer in Norwegian waters, there has been a downturn in the fishing industry in the town. This has led to redundancies in the fish processing industry, in which the fish factory workers have been the hardest hit.","path":[74723,-8.441315,54.63055,73373,-8.439745,54.63043,72983,-8.440665,54.63022,72744,-8.445189,54.63247,72113,-8.442944,54.63594,71873,-8.442503,54.63526,71634,-8.439112,54.63377,71454,-8.43593,54.62835,71306,-8.442014,54.61753,71153,-8.474625,54.59879,70919,-8.490909,54.62846,70673,-8.490713,54.62921,70492,-8.489945,54.62889,70342,-8.490648,54.62932,70134,-8.48831,54.62717,69954,-8.489928,54.62875,69719,-8.490666,54.62946,69503,-8.493007,54.6283,69383,-8.48998,54.62714,69203,-8.492309,54.62891,69082,-8.490037,54.6296,68873,-8.491225,54.62859,68692,-8.487045,54.63155,68392,-8.487425,54.63165,67852,-8.488317,54.63209,66951,-8.48777,54.63328,66773,-8.488095,54.63291,66591,-8.488358,54.63243,66052,-8.490797,54.63125,65901,-8.495067,54.62407,65722,-8.477137,54.59967,65601,-8.449821,54.61272,65392,-8.4373,54.62828,65211,-8.437832,54.633,65031,-8.442587,54.63579,64793,-8.442833,54.63563]},{"name":"GREEN ISLE","text":"GREEN ISLE:Green Isle may refer to a community in the United States:Green Isle is a city in Sibley County, Minnesota, United States.

During his voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures going to magical places, meeting monsters, and encountering supernatural phenomena.Origins and sources: The tales of Sinbad are a relatively late addition to the One Thousand and One Nights – they don't feature in the earliest 14th-century manuscript, and appear as an independent cycle in 17th and 18th century collections. The first known point at which they are associated with the Nights is a Turkish collection dated 1637. One of several possible etymologies of the name is Sindh and the Persian word bâd, which means wind. This would give a plausible meaning of \"India-wind\".Traceable influences include the Homeric epics (long familiar in the Arabic-speaking world, having been translated into that language as long ago as the 8th century A.D., at the court of the Caliph al-Mahdi), Pseudo-Callisthenes's \"Life of Alexander\" from the late-3rd/early 4th century A.D. via the 9th century \"Book of Animals\" of al-Jahiz, and, even earlier, in the ancient Egyptian \"Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor\". More \"recent\" sources include Abbasid works such the \"Wonders of the Created World\", reflecting the experiences of 13th century Arab mariners who braved the Indian Ocean.The Sinbad cycle is set in the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid. It first appeared in English as tale 120 in Volume 6 of Sir Richard Burton's 1885 translation of The Book of One Thousand and One Nights.Sinbad the Porter and Sinbad the Sailor. Like the 1001 Nights the Sinbad story-cycle has a frame story which goes as follows: in the days of Harun al-Rashid, Caliph of Baghdad, a poor porter (one who carries goods for others in the market and throughout the city) pauses to rest on a bench outside the gate of a rich merchant's house, where he complains to Allah about the injustice of a world which allows the rich to live in ease while he must toil and yet remain poor. The owner of the house hears and sends for the porter, finding that they are both named Sinbad. The rich Sinbad tells the poor Sinbad that he became wealthy \"by Fortune and Fate\" in the course of seven wondrous voyages, which he then proceeds to relate.","path":[69646,-8.439551,54.63076,69409,-8.438437,54.63091,69259,-8.437636,54.62721,69140,-8.439335,54.62337,69019,-8.441347,54.61956,68898,-8.443883,54.61584,68778,-8.445735,54.61212,68628,-8.447623,54.60787,68479,-8.450513,54.6074,68360,-8.450802,54.60806,68240,-8.449017,54.6095,68060,-8.446075,54.61267,67878,-8.443885,54.61683,67703,-8.44135,54.62075,67489,-8.438077,54.6255,67337,-8.43658,54.62896,67160,-8.439493,54.63064,58023,-8.437449,54.63026,57574,-8.437952,54.62863,57364,-8.437464,54.62558,57213,-8.439207,54.62076,57039,-8.441448,54.61532,56883,-8.443104,54.61044,56733,-8.44454,54.60576,56552,-8.445764,54.60023,56336,-8.446544,54.59924,56094,-8.44283,54.60047,55822,-8.439776,54.60147,55670,-8.438258,54.60271,55461,-8.439339,54.60451,55340,-8.441029,54.60548,55129,-8.448997,54.60429,54892,-8.449984,54.60707,54556,-8.449306,54.60617,54435,-8.449545,54.60629,54316,-8.449148,54.60859,54106,-8.444583,54.61453,53926,-8.441308,54.61978,53776,-8.43893,54.62417,53659,-8.437333,54.62765,53530,-8.437306,54.63075,52271,-8.439518,54.63075,51012,-8.439513,54.63073,49746,-8.439593,54.63085,38742,-8.439525,54.63075,38531,-8.437223,54.62982,37446,-8.437654,54.62949,37262,-8.437576,54.62932]},{"name":"WESTWARD ISLE","text":"WESTWARD ISLE:Ducie lies 290 miles (470 km) east of Pitcairn Island and is claimed by some to be the southernmost atoll in the world at 24 degrees south latitude.[29] However, Middleton Reef is at 29 degrees south latitude, so the assertion on behalf of Ducie Island is doubtful. Ducie Island's land area is 170 acres (1 km2) and its maximum elevation, occurring on the Westward islet, is 15 feet (4.6 m).Ducie is located 620 miles (1,000 km) west of the edge of the Easter Plate. It was formed approximately 8 million years ago,[31] after Oeno Island was formed by a hotspot that later caused a magma leak generated in the Oeno lineation. The leak spread over fracture zone FZ2, which was formed by the third movement of the Pacific Plate.[32] The atoll is part of the Oeno-Henderson-Ducie-Crough seamount, speculated to be part of the southern Tuamotus.The atoll consists of four islets: Acadia, Pandora, Westward and Edwards.[33] The last three of these can be accessed on foot from Acadia at low tide.[29] The islets were named by Harald Rehder and John Randall, who visited the atoll during an expedition by the Smithsonian Institution in 1975.Acadia Islet, along the atoll's north and east rim, is larger than the other three islets combined, measuring 140 acres (57 ha. Very long and thin, the islet is largely forested and is composed of ridges of coral rubble. It is named after the Acadia, a ship that was wrecked on Ducie in 1881.Pandora Islet, in the south, is the second largest. It is composed of sand and coral rubble that borders the lagoon. It is named after HMS Pandora.Edwards Islet lies immediately to the east of Pandora Islet and has the same characteristics. It is named after Edward Edwards, captain of HMS Pandora.Westward Islet, west of Pandora Islet, is the smallest. It appears sandy from a distance, but the soil is composed of coral rubble and dead shells. Its highest point rises 15 feet (4.6 m) above average sea level. It is named after the Westward, the ship that carried the members of the National Geographic Society and the Oceanic Institute during their 1970–71 expedition.The atoll has a central lagoon, accessible by boat only by way of a channel 100 yards (91 m) wide located in the southwest, between Pandora and Westward Islets. It has a maximum depth of 52 feet (16 m) and its bottom consists of sand and coral. Whirlpools in the lagoon are common, caused by tunnels that drain the water from the lagoon into the ocean","path":[81639,-8.439303,54.63594,80340,-8.439379,54.63595,79130,-8.439285,54.63594,77671,-8.439363,54.63601,76469,-8.439241,54.63596,75120,-8.43929,54.63599,73849,-8.439235,54.63592,72510,-8.43933,54.636,71240,-8.439272,54.63597,69999,-8.439259,54.63594,68760,-8.439332,54.63586,67510,-8.439386,54.63589,66199,-8.439382,54.63589,64910,-8.439372,54.63579,63609,-8.43949,54.63589,62310,-8.439348,54.63581,62163,-8.439123,54.63569,61893,-8.438501,54.63418,61750,-8.437257,54.63258,61539,-8.436668,54.62783,61409,-8.438182,54.62473,61271,-8.440244,54.62149,61140,-8.442476,54.61849,60930,-8.44646,54.61305,60809,-8.448997,54.60997,60689,-8.452128,54.60597,60569,-8.455544,54.60227,60420,-8.460069,54.59824,60249,-8.464005,54.59508,60120,-8.463509,54.5954,59929,-8.468661,54.59433,59732,-8.474257,54.59187,59589,-8.48035,54.5905,59439,-8.485621,54.58939,59283,-8.490612,54.58811,59149,-8.492126,54.5885,58989,-8.493932,54.58831,58770,-8.49629,54.58836,58530,-8.497844,54.58972,58290,-8.498245,54.59086,58097,-8.49899,54.59018,57956,-8.49443,54.59,57750,-8.489516,54.59119,57610,-8.486123,54.59202,57480,-8.483045,54.59273,57340,-8.479776,54.59349,57209,-8.47666,54.59421,57080,-8.473612,54.59493,56939,-8.468863,54.59637,56789,-8.46584,54.59759,56591,-8.461202,54.59932,56384,-8.454765,54.60263,56219,-8.452735,54.60513,55959,-8.449445,54.6099,55810,-8.446663,54.61355,55600,-8.442313,54.61831,55450,-8.440269,54.62155,55309,-8.438258,54.62452,55160,-8.437536,54.62761,55020,-8.43769,54.62929,54621,-8.437763,54.62932,53340,-8.437763,54.62928,52071,-8.437688,54.62928,50729,-8.437662,54.62924,49380,-8.437723,54.62929,48139,-8.437715,54.62926,46891,-8.437738,54.62925,45659,-8.437743,54.62932,44340,-8.437778,54.62929,42970,-8.437721,54.62931,41670,-8.43764,54.62934,40380,-8.437701,54.62933,39121,-8.437672,54.62932,37850,-8.437735,54.62928,36619,-8.437752,54.62925,36508,-8.437313,54.62933,36309,-8.436815,54.62712,36091,-8.441869,54.61881,35950,-8.446177,54.6132,35730,-8.454706,54.60489,35590,-8.461677,54.60041,35370,-8.474985,54.59489,35190,-8.487186,54.59157,35030,-8.498114,54.58868,34870,-8.509033,54.58584,34730,-8.518998,54.58442,34570,-8.531009,54.5836,34429,-8.541536,54.58371,34249,-8.554927,54.58427,34100,-8.565984,54.58482,33980,-8.574862,54.5859,33841,-8.585076,54.58751,33710,-8.594535,54.58917,33510,-8.608963,54.59211,33350,-8.620288,54.59455,33150,-8.634595,54.5976,33009,-8.644631,54.5997,32870,-8.653925,54.60247,32670,-8.667077,54.60654,32529,-8.676476,54.60941,32379,-8.686408,54.61245,32230,-8.695613,54.61616,32020,-8.707922,54.62199,31880,-8.715955,54.62602,31730,-8.724608,54.63029,31580,-8.733555,54.63445,31440,-8.742285,54.63799,31280,-8.75262,54.64191,31119,-8.763997,54.64476,30968,-8.774583,54.64749,30750,-8.789177,54.65229,30609,-8.79847,54.65553,30469,-8.806943,54.65934]},{"name":"FAGRABERG","text":"FAGRABERG:Tast received position is 55.93423 N / 8.36782 W on Apr 23, 2017 at 15:50 UTC.\nFishing Vessel FAGRABERG (IMO: 9184641, MMSI: 231091000) is a fishing vessel built in 1999 and currently sailing under the flag of Faeroe Islands.

TEE","text":"FIONA TEE:Fiona is a feminine given name. It was invented and first used by the Scottish poet James Macpherson (1736–96), author of the Ossian poems which he claimed were translations from ancient Gaelic sources (sources which, when challenged, he never produced). The name was subsequently used as a pseudonym by William Sharp (1855–1905), who authored several romantic works under the name \"Fiona Macleod\". The name has since become popular in England, Scotland and Ireland.[The name is considered to be a Latinised form of the Gaelic word fionn, meaning \"white\", \"fair\".The name Fiona is also sometimes used as an Anglicisation of the Irish-language name Fíona, although these names are otherwise unrelated (as Fíona is derived from an element meaning \"vine\").[2] There is also a modern tendency to equate the authentic Scottish Gaelic feminine name Fionnghal with Fiona.\nThe name Fiona is rising in popularity particularly in German-speaking countries. Fiona was the 49th most popular name for baby girls born in 2008 in Germany.[4] Fiona was tied for third place in the ranking of most popular names for baby girls born in the tiny principality of Liechtenstein in 2008.[5] The name was the 347th most popular name for girls born in the United States in 2008, where it has ranked among the top 1,000 most popular names for girls since 1990 and among the top 500 since 1999.[6] The name Fiona has been particularly popular for girls of Asian or Pacific Islander descent in New York City, where Fiona ranked as the ninth most popular name for girls from those groups in 2007.","path":[45347,-8.443722,54.63278,45199,-8.437404,54.63251,45046,-8.437384,54.6245,44866,-8.442175,54.6144,44688,-8.447248,54.60455,44510,-8.454356,54.59489,44357,-8.462087,54.58736,44177,-8.471169,54.57831,44028,-8.470491,54.57024,43848,-8.46332,54.56093,43698,-8.459295,54.55278,43519,-8.45451,54.54301,43401,-8.45289,54.53631,43218,-8.450804,54.5258,43068,-8.449037,54.51717,42919,-8.447244,54.50852,42798,-8.445514,54.5015,42652,-8.44351,54.49292,42470,-8.442277,54.48224,42320,-8.441753,54.47355,42138,-8.4451,54.46488,41598,-8.445833,54.46546,40339,-8.445851,54.46547,39079,-8.445867,54.46547,37730,-8.445855,54.46546,37550,-8.444883,54.4649,37341,-8.439029,54.46463,37220,-8.428877,54.46124,37100,-8.422328,54.46144,36980,-8.415715,54.46282,36830,-8.414019,54.46295,36651,-8.423616,54.46131,36500,-8.428953,54.46053,36110,-8.432035,54.46057,35961,-8.438697,54.46155,35812,-8.444232,54.46535,35631,-8.443069,54.47143,35481,-8.442567,54.47526,35362,-8.444623,54.47579,35241,-8.446762,54.4762,35061,-8.454063,54.47834,34912,-8.447978,54.47459,34762,-8.44371,54.4698,34611,-8.445084,54.46492,33683,-8.44588,54.46545,33533,-8.446062,54.46522,33263,-8.445889,54.46546,33142,-8.446181,54.4654,32962,-8.445889,54.46547,32813,-8.446241,54.46507,31792,-8.445871,54.46546,30533,-8.445885,54.46544,29274,-8.4459,54.46544,27925,-8.445927,54.46544,26724,-8.445953,54.46543,26604,-8.444382,54.46517,26426,-8.437768,54.47419,26245,-8.437795,54.48431,26125,-8.441335,54.4908,25974,-8.446422,54.49885,25794,-8.454407,54.50784,25555,-8.465235,54.51999,25408,-8.468879,54.52804,25286,-8.470529,54.53487,25165,-8.471457,54.5418,24987,-8.472756,54.55214,24866,-8.47351,54.55914,24717,-8.474345,54.56791,24535,-8.472775,54.57827]},{"name":"MERIDIAN","text":"MERIDIAN: A (geographical) meridian (or line of longitude) is the half of an imaginary great circle on the Earth's surface, terminated by the North Pole and the South Pole, connecting points of equal longitude. The position of a point along the meridian is given by its latitude indicating how many degrees north or south of the Equator the point is. Each meridian is perpendicular to all circles of latitude. Each is also the same length, being half of a great circle on the Earth's surface and therefore measuring 20,003.93 km (12,429.9 miles).The meridian through Greenwich (inside Greenwich Park), England, called the Prime Meridian, was set at zero degrees of longitude, while other meridians were defined by the angle at the center of the earth between where it and the prime meridian cross the equator. As there are 360 degrees in a circle, the meridian on the opposite side of the earth from Greenwich, the International Date Line, forms the other half of a circle with the one through Greenwich, and is at roughly 180° longitude (with land mass and island deviations for boundary reasons). The meridians from West of Greenwich (0°) to the International Date Line (180°) define the Western Hemisphere and the meridians from East of Greenwich (0°) to the International Date Line (180°) define the Eastern Hemisphere. Most maps show the lines of longitude.The position of the prime meridian has changed a few times throughout history, mainly due to the transit observatory being built next door to the previous one (to maintain the service to shipping). Such changes had no significant practical effect. Historically, the average error in the determination of longitude was much larger than the change in position. The adoption of WGS84 (\"World Geodetic System 84\") as the positioning system has moved the geodetic prime meridian 102.478 metres east of its last astronomic position (measured at Greenwich). The position of the current geodetic prime meridian is not identified at all by any kind of sign or marking (as the older astronomic position was) in Greenwich, but can be located using a GPS receiver. The term \"meridian\" comes from the Latin meridies, meaning \"midday\"; the sun crosses a given meridian midway between the times of sunrise and sunset on that meridian. The same Latin stem gives rise to the terms a.m. (ante meridiem) and p.m. (post meridiem) used to disambiguate hours of the day when utilizing the 12-hour clock.Magnetic: The magnetic meridian is an equivalent imaginary line connecting the magnetic south and north poles and can be taken as the horizontal component of magnetic force lines along the surface of the earth.[1][dubious – discuss] Therefore, a compass needle will be parallel to the magnetic meridian. The angle between the magnetic and the true meridian is the magnetic declination, which is relevant for navigating with a compass.\n\n","path":[81542,-8.44447,54.63263,80102,-8.444467,54.63263,78847,-8.444435,54.63263,77583,-8.44445,54.63263,76143,-8.444438,54.63263,74883,-8.444455,54.63264,73623,-8.444455,54.63264,72184,-8.444451,54.63265,70743,-8.44444,54.63266,69486,-8.444458,54.63265,68225,-8.444455,54.63265,66966,-8.444453,54.63265,65705,-8.444491,54.63265,64444,-8.444484,54.63264,63184,-8.444475,54.63263,61565,-8.444471,54.63262,60304,-8.444455,54.63262,59047,-8.44444,54.63265,57785,-8.444451,54.63263,56528,-8.444448,54.63264,55265,-8.444417,54.6326,54006,-8.444407,54.6326,52747,-8.444442,54.6326,51486,-8.444425,54.63259,50226,-8.444425,54.6326,48966,-8.444408,54.6326,47707,-8.444425,54.63263,46447,-8.444407,54.63262,45187,-8.444395,54.63261,43749,-8.444357,54.63259,42368,-8.444386,54.63256,42188,-8.438916,54.63363,42068,-8.435317,54.62941,41919,-8.438498,54.62324,41769,-8.443665,54.61743,41558,-8.452742,54.61029,41380,-8.461039,54.60469,41228,-8.471051,54.60219,41079,-8.481787,54.60139,40901,-8.494882,54.60209,40750,-8.506066,54.60266,40631,-8.514771,54.60314,40481,-8.525683,54.60365,40299,-8.53897,54.60379,40149,-8.549842,54.60389,39941,-8.565075,54.60403,39760,-8.578265,54.60413,39580,-8.59127,54.60509,39400,-8.60327,54.60817,39250,-8.612285,54.61185,39041,-8.62343,54.61783,38861,-8.628288,54.62344,38715,-8.631469,54.62466,37793,-8.63135,54.62454,37613,-8.629858,54.62505,37463,-8.626775,54.62211,37283,-8.630835,54.61801,37104,-8.639793,54.61641,36953,-8.646693,54.61605,36775,-8.654565,54.61575,36625,-8.66109,54.61563,36505,-8.66625,54.61599,36324,-8.67394,54.61655,36146,-8.681535,54.61727,35936,-8.687777,54.62021,35786,-8.689894,54.62327,35664,-8.691733,54.62574,35485,-8.693169,54.62948,35276,-8.691463,54.63387,35125,-8.693965,54.63669,34945,-8.697705,54.63973,34737,-8.701511,54.64094,34586,-8.69641,54.64019,34376,-8.690812,54.63745,34168,-8.686827,54.634,34018,-8.68527,54.63141,33837,-8.691105,54.6281,33626,-8.685815,54.62097,33446,-8.675076,54.61775,33269,-8.662113,54.61782,33118,-8.651417,54.61819,32968,-8.641249,54.61843,32817,-8.631248,54.61982,32639,-8.630177,54.62451,31596,-8.631402,54.62453,31264,-8.625932,54.62105,31056,-8.61702,54.61323,30876,-8.605719,54.60843,30695,-8.592892,54.60527,30517,-8.578858,54.60492,30365,-8.566895,54.60461,30185,-8.552564,54.60424,29977,-8.53605,54.60386,29796,-8.52167,54.60359,29649,-8.509932,54.60337,29469,-8.495602,54.60292,29256,-8.480013,54.60206,29078,-8.467176,54.60339,28928,-8.458596,54.60707,28778,-8.45162,54.61159,28627,-8.445825,54.6166,28507,-8.442052,54.62076,28357,-8.437656,54.62595,28179,-8.436978,54.63152,28028,-8.442159,54.63363,27884,-8.444478,54.63255,27381,-8.444451,54.63258]}]}
