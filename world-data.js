For film in Northern Ireland, see Cinema of Northern Ireland.The Irish film industry has grown somewhat in recent years thanks partly to the promotion of the sector by Bord Scannán na hÉireann (Irish Film Board) and the introduction of heavy tax breaks. According to the Irish Audiovisual Content Production Sector Review carried out by the Irish Film Board and PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2008 this sector, has gone from 1,000 people employed six or seven years ago, to well over 6,000 people in that sector now and is valued at over €557.3 million and represents 0.3% of GDP.According to an article in Variety magazine spotlighting Irish cinema, a decade ago Ireland had only two filmmakers anyone had heard of: Neil Jordan and Jim Sheridan. As of 2010, Ireland can boast more than a dozen directors and writers with significant and growing international reputations. Ireland is now achieving critical mass of filmmaking talent to match the kind of influence, disproportionate to its small size, that it has always enjoyed in the fields of literature and theatre. Following in the footsteps of Sheridan and Jordan comes a generation that includes such directors as Lenny Abrahamson, Conor McPherson, John Crowley, Martin McDonagh, John Carney, Kirsten Sheridan, Lance Daly, Paddy Breathnach and Damien O'Donnell and writers such as Mark O'Rowe, Enda Walsh and Mark O'Halloran.Former Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen (2008–2010) said that “the film industry is the cornerstone of a smart and creative digital economy”.[8] But as well as the concrete economic benefits that the Irish film industry brings in by way of cash investment from overseas and the associated VAT, PAYE and PRSI receipts, it has been noted that there are the soft benefits in terms of the development and projection of the Irish culture and the promotion of tourism.While big-budget international productions keep crews working and are enormously valuable to the country, it is the indigenous industry that is at the heart of creating opportunity and giving skills and experience to Irish producers, directors, writers and crew, telling the stories that emerge from Irish-based talent.[10] Some of the most successful Irish films include The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), Intermission (2003), Man About Dog (2004), Michael Collins (1996), Angela's Ashes (1999), The Commitments (1991) and Once (2007). Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie (2014) holds the record for the biggest gross on the opening day of an Irish film in Ireland.[In the past many films were censored or banned, owing largely to the influence of the Catholic Church, although virtually no cuts or bans have been issued in recent years, one as of August 2006. The Irish Film Censor's Office policy is that of personal choice for the viewer, considering his job to examine and classify films rather than censor them.]","path":[82681,-10.15639,51.56133,82522,-10.14787,51.56225,82391,-10.1409,51.56305,82172,-10.12917,51.56436,82011,-10.12047,51.56528,81852,-10.11174,51.56628,81701,-10.10342,51.56719,81542,-10.09467,51.56815,81392,-10.08647,51.56903,81251,-10.07874,51.56999,81101,-10.07051,51.57101,80960,-10.06283,51.57196,80812,-10.05472,51.57295,80662,-10.04655,51.57396,80510,-10.03828,51.57497,80362,-10.03021,51.57621,80222,-10.02267,51.57762,80090,-10.01611,51.57969,79941,-10.00848,51.58194,79801,-10.00135,51.58405,79661,-9.994105,51.58614,79511,-9.986267,51.58839,79292,-9.97484,51.5917,79142,-9.967112,51.59392,78932,-9.95625,51.59705,78790,-9.94937,51.59926,78572,-9.939379,51.6027,78430,-9.93349,51.60534,78270,-9.929132,51.6099,78141,-9.926525,51.61384,77849,-9.922645,51.62145,77712,-9.920888,51.62416,77571,-9.91892,51.62701,77422,-9.916955,51.63,77281,-9.914945,51.63262,77071,-9.912512,51.63629,76930,-9.910653,51.63863,76712,-9.908905,51.64266,76571,-9.908468,51.64511,76431,-9.9079,51.64727,76260,-9.906413,51.64897,75880,-9.905407,51.64903,74632,-9.90537,51.64909,73351,-9.905401,51.64906,72061,-9.905416,51.64899,70752,-9.905427,51.64903,69392,-9.905392,51.649,68151,-9.905407,51.64905,66871,-9.9053,51.64905,65571,-9.905398,51.64905,64201,-9.905372,51.64901,62841,-9.905383,51.64901,61491,-9.90537,51.64902,60161,-9.905372,51.64899,58781,-9.90543,51.64901,57471,-9.905363,51.64897,56141,-9.905392,51.64906,54782,-9.90535,51.64899,53361,-9.90541,51.649,51990,-9.905367,51.649,50602,-9.905343,51.64899,49261,-9.905376,51.64914,47922,-9.905374,51.64899,46562,-9.9054,51.64901,45162,-9.905327,51.64902,44910,-9.905369,51.649,43521,-9.905365,51.64902,42151,-9.905356,51.64902,40801,-9.90537,51.64905,39461,-9.905369,51.64905,38102,-9.905395,51.64905,36822,-9.905372,51.64901,35432,-9.905407,51.64905,34112,-9.905414,51.64902,32860,-9.905388,51.64902,31511,-9.905425,51.64903,30181,-9.905396,51.64907,28841,-9.905401,51.64902,27561,-9.905408,51.64901,26191,-9.905358,51.64909,24901,-9.905385,51.64902,23551,-9.905376,51.64907,22222,-9.905233,51.64892,20871,-9.905418,51.64908,19531,-9.905349,51.64904,18192,-9.905365,51.64903,16821,-9.905421,51.64907,15491,-9.905338,51.64902,14141,-9.905367,51.64905,12781,-9.905349,51.649,11440,-9.905408,51.64904,10061,-9.905421,51.64906,8732,-9.905305,51.64899,7402,-9.905355,51.64904,6072,-9.905401,51.64904,4740,-9.905336,51.64903,3400,-9.905415,51.64904,2062,-9.905388,51.64902,751,-9.905395,51.64899]},{"name":"RNLI LIFEBOAT 17-44","text":"RNLI LIFEBOAT The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is the largest charity that saves lives at sea around the coasts of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as well as on some inland waterways. There are numerous other lifeboat services operating in the same area. Founded in 1824 as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, the RNLI was granted Royal Charter in 1860 and is a charity in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Queen Elizabeth II is Patron. The RNLI is principally funded by legacies and donations with most lifeboat crew members being unpaid volunteers. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and operates 444 lifeboats. Crews rescued on average 22 people a day in 2015. RNLI Lifeguards operate on more than 200 beaches. They are paid by local authorities, while the RNLI provides equipment and training. The Institution operates Flood Rescue Teams (FRT) nationally and internationally (iFRT), the latter prepared to travel to emergencies overseas at short notice. Considerable effort is put into training and education by the Institution, particularly for young people; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. The Institution has saved some 140,000 lives since its foundation, at a cost of more than 600 lives lost in service. Sir William Hillary came to live on the Isle of Man in 1808. Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast, he drew up plans for a national lifeboat service manned by trained crews. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty. However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, with the help of Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert, the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824. At the age of 60, Sir William took part in the 1830 rescue of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. He commanded the lifeboat and was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. It was this incident which prompted Sir William to set up a scheme to build The Tower of Refuge on Conister Rock – a project completed in 1832 which stands to this day at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. In 1854 the institution's name changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (in 1849 Prince Albert had added his support to the Institution[1]) and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of the work of Sir William.1974 postage stamp marking the RNLI's 150th anniversary (rescue of Daunt Lightship's crew by Ballycotton lifeboat RNLB Mary Stanford. Artist: B. F. Gribble)In its first year the RNLI raised £10,000, however by 1849, income had dropped to £354.[3] Finding itself in financial difficulties, the RNLI accepted a government subsidy of £2,000, which rose in subsequent years. This lasted until 1869, when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies; in addition, the government's imposition of bureaucracy and regulations were detrimental to the service.[4] It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new impetus to fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £10,000. The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year.","path":[82165,-9.907898,51.65185,80824,-9.907904,51.65187,79445,-9.907937,51.65183,78056,-9.907831,51.65182,76656,-9.907917,51.65183,75325,-9.907851,51.65187,73976,-9.907788,51.65188,72515,-9.907866,51.65189,71225,-9.907842,51.65189,69845,-9.907891,51.65187,69725,-9.907162,51.65151,69595,-9.907148,51.65057,69335,-9.90789,51.65175,69194,-9.907703,51.65162,69015,-9.906593,51.65087,68874,-9.906384,51.64986,68725,-9.906058,51.64931,68514,-9.9079,51.64691,68366,-9.908508,51.64324,68224,-9.91011,51.63966,68075,-9.912947,51.63619,67925,-9.917405,51.6333,67815,-9.918905,51.63243,67554,-9.919224,51.63149,67324,-9.91896,51.63097,67204,-9.91811,51.63099,67044,-9.917143,51.63143,66755,-9.917111,51.63192,66624,-9.917417,51.63214,66485,-9.917718,51.63239,66215,-9.918417,51.63295,65975,-9.91576,51.63326,65823,-9.910582,51.6392,65665,-9.90801,51.64649,65503,-9.907195,51.65126,64963,-9.907665,51.65178,63633,-9.907873,51.65185,62325,-9.907868,51.65184,61034,-9.907866,51.65181,59655,-9.907888,51.65187,58255,-9.907848,51.65187,56974,-9.907902,51.65188,55585,-9.90799,51.65186,54255,-9.907915,51.65194,52855,-9.9078,51.65184,51545,-9.907878,51.65187,50115,-9.907851,51.6518,48825,-9.907915,51.65185,47474,-9.907907,51.65185,46085,-9.90784,51.65186,44725,-9.907893,51.65189,43404,-9.907853,51.65187,42044,-9.907857,51.65186,40635,-9.90783,51.65186,39295,-9.907784,51.65182,37954,-9.907779,51.65189,36584,-9.907808,51.65188,35314,-9.907851,51.65181,34033,-9.90788,51.65185,32675,-9.907786,51.65184,31294,-9.907898,51.65189,29935,-9.907837,51.65179,28584,-9.907858,51.6518,27285,-9.907884,51.65187,25855,-9.90785,51.65182,24515,-9.907917,51.65181,23115,-9.907957,51.65182,21755,-9.907888,51.65187,20434,-9.907942,51.65187,19024,-9.907875,51.65187,17645,-9.907925,51.65187,16274,-9.90789,51.65187,15015,-9.907845,51.65189,13665,-9.907846,51.65191,12263,-9.907875,51.65185,10875,-9.90792,51.65191,9595,-9.90787,51.65185,8284,-9.90782,51.65189,6985,-9.907851,51.65185,5654,-9.907825,51.65187,4425,-9.90785,51.65181,3064,-9.907864,51.65184,1845,-9.907931,51.65187,503,-9.907833,51.65191]},{"name":"OCEAN CHALLENGER","text":"OCEAN CHALLENGER:An ocean (from Ancient Greek Ὠκεανός, transc. Okeanós, the sea of classical antiquity[1]) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere.[2] On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.[3][4] The word sea is often used interchangeably with \"ocean\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.Saline water covers approximately 72% of the planet's surface (~3.6×108 km2) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's biosphere.[6] The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water, and oceanographers have stated that less than 5% of the World Ocean has been explored.[6] The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters (12,100 ft).As the world ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, it is integral to all known life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns. The world ocean is the habitat of 230,000 known species, but because much of it is unexplored, the number of species that exist is much larger, possibly over two million.[10] The origin of Earth's oceans remains unknown; oceans are thought to have formed in the Hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life.Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds. The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan, although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System. Early in their geologic histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans. The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of Europa is estimated to have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System's giant planets are also thought to have liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions. Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone. Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.Etymology: The word « ocean » comes from the figure in classical antiquity, Oceanus (/oʊˈsiːənəs/; Greek: Ὠκεανός Ōkeanós,[13] pronounced [ɔːkeanós]), the elder of the Titans in classical Greek mythology, believed by the ancient Greeks and Romans to be the divine personification of the sea, an enormous river encircling the world.The concept of Ōkeanós has an Indo-European connection. Greek Ōkeanós has been compared to the Vedic epithet ā-śáyāna-, predicated of the dragon Vṛtra-, who captured the cows/rivers. Related to this notion, the Okeanos is represented with a dragon-tail on some early Greek vases.","path":[82639,-9.904703,51.64953,81380,-9.904715,51.64948,80118,-9.904629,51.64945,78860,-9.90467,51.64949,77598,-9.904714,51.64948,76159,-9.904698,51.64942,74898,-9.904655,51.64945,73639,-9.904775,51.64943,72378,-9.904665,51.64944,71117,-9.904703,51.64948,69859,-9.904715,51.64944,68599,-9.90465,51.64951,67339,-9.904712,51.64948,66078,-9.90468,51.64954,64818,-9.904734,51.64952,63559,-9.904683,51.64945,62297,-9.90467,51.64953,61037,-9.90464,51.64947,59778,-9.90469,51.64944,58517,-9.90463,51.64949,57257,-9.90465,51.64948,55997,-9.904701,51.64944,54737,-9.904555,51.64941,53535,-9.904899,51.64939,53407,-9.905512,51.64931,53198,-9.907905,51.64717,53055,-9.90808,51.64301,52929,-9.90417,51.64122,52795,-9.89631,51.64242,52595,-9.882513,51.64456,52448,-9.872501,51.64614,52308,-9.862944,51.64751,52159,-9.852725,51.6489,52019,-9.842823,51.64919,51859,-9.831587,51.64922,51719,-9.8217,51.64934,51568,-9.811085,51.64975,51429,-9.801332,51.65044,51282,-9.791005,51.65116,51142,-9.781183,51.65172,51005,-9.771519,51.65118,50859,-9.761383,51.64991,50728,-9.752335,51.64875,50599,-9.743207,51.648,50459,-9.733555,51.64888,50252,-9.719711,51.65176,50109,-9.710254,51.65382,49968,-9.700945,51.65593,49828,-9.691677,51.65803,49597,-9.676443,51.66141,49449,-9.6668,51.66351,49299,-9.656959,51.66566,49149,-9.647099,51.66777,49007,-9.637807,51.66977,48857,-9.627974,51.67196,48699,-9.617496,51.67432,48558,-9.608263,51.67639,48348,-9.594497,51.67964,48198,-9.585326,51.68288,48048,-9.576292,51.68627,47895,-9.567139,51.68966,47751,-9.560165,51.69225,47598,-9.555112,51.69428,47449,-9.54959,51.69627,47289,-9.543457,51.69826,47155,-9.538148,51.69961,46955,-9.53148,51.6991,46328,-9.53237,51.69833,45019,-9.532369,51.69865,44899,-9.532515,51.69882,44775,-9.532753,51.69924,44645,-9.533016,51.69938,44531,-9.533465,51.69942,44401,-9.534093,51.6996,44148,-9.534542,51.69971,42751,-9.537465,51.69923,42621,-9.537211,51.69845,42497,-9.536603,51.6979,42225,-9.536433,51.69757,41985,-9.537032,51.69765,41798,-9.540462,51.69481,41648,-9.546257,51.68972,41441,-9.55343,51.68244,41297,-9.555741,51.67673,41161,-9.5549,51.67169,40958,-9.542309,51.67347,40811,-9.534119,51.67615,40598,-9.529252,51.68114,39387,-9.52903,51.68146,38018,-9.529132,51.68122,37778,-9.52985,51.68051,37538,-9.534212,51.67584,37387,-9.541536,51.67263,37236,-9.54958,51.67015,37077,-9.558197,51.66788,36876,-9.569952,51.66628,36736,-9.579449,51.66508,36604,-9.58868,51.66397,36398,-9.603037,51.66241,36248,-9.613537,51.66123,36106,-9.623605,51.66031,35967,-9.633347,51.65937,35821,-9.643643,51.65835,35688,-9.65304,51.6574,35547,-9.66301,51.65641,35404,-9.673175,51.65537,35206,-9.687243,51.65385,35067,-9.697,51.65295,34928,-9.70671,51.65197,34714,-9.72167,51.65033,34577,-9.731189,51.64912,34441,-9.740586,51.64788,34297,-9.750952,51.64777,34156,-9.760674,51.64915,34010,-9.770324,51.65133,33867,-9.780534,51.65123,33727,-9.790588,51.65082,33577,-9.801512,51.65041,33433,-9.811853,51.64978,33277,-9.823125,51.64907,33117,-9.834695,51.64857,32937,-9.847834,51.64812,32737,-9.862365,51.64766,32600,-9.872108,51.64611,32467,-9.881547,51.64459,32327,-9.89129,51.64316,32130,-9.904462,51.64104,32000,-9.90812,51.64401,31867,-9.907845,51.64757,31724,-9.906713,51.64973,31587,-9.90703,51.6502,31448,-9.90751,51.65048,31056,-9.908185,51.6508,29817,-9.90826,51.65077,28558,-9.908288,51.65084,27298,-9.908237,51.6508,26037,-9.90821,51.65081,24777,-9.908198,51.65088,23518,-9.90821,51.65079,22257,-9.908183,51.65083,20997,-9.908281,51.65079,19738,-9.908205,51.65082,18477,-9.908225,51.65087,17218,-9.908274,51.6508,15959,-9.908172,51.65083,14697,-9.908183,51.65083,13438,-9.908247,51.65076,12178,-9.9082,51.65081,10919,-9.908238,51.65075,9659,-9.908235,51.65074,8399,-9.90815,51.65079,7137,-9.90822,51.65078,5877,-9.908228,51.65083,4618,-9.908174,51.65081,3358,-9.908221,51.65081,2099,-9.90821,51.6508,658,-9.908285,51.65081]},{"name":"BRITANNIA V","text":"BRITANNIA V:Britannia was the Greek and Roman term for the geographical region of Great Britain or Great Britain and Ireland which was inhabited by the Britons, Belgae and Picts and is the name given to the female personification of the island. It is a term still used to refer to the island today. The name is Latin, and derives from the Greek form Prettanike or Brettaniai, which originally designated a collection of islands with individual names, including Albion or Great Britain; however, by the 1st century BC, Britannia came to be used for Great Britain specifically. In AD 43 the Roman Empire began its conquest of the island, establishing a province they called Britannia, which came to encompass the parts of the island south of Caledonia (roughly Scotland). In the 2nd century, Roman Britannia came to be personified as a goddess, armed with a trident and shield and wearing a Corinthian helmet. The name Britannia long survived the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 5th century and yielded the name for the island in most European and various other languages, including the English Britain and the modern Welsh Prydain. After centuries of declining use, the Latin form was revived during the English Renaissance as a rhetorical evocation of a British national identity. Especially following the Acts of Union in 1707, which joined the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, the personification of the martial Britannia was used as an emblem of British imperial power and unity. A British cultural icon, she was featured on all modern British coinage series until the redesign in 2008, and still appears annually on the gold and silver \"Britannia\" bullion coin series. In 2015 a new definitive £2 coin was issued, with a new image of Britannia.

As such he is brother-in-law to Isaac and both father-in-law and uncle to Jacob. Laban and his family were described as dwelling in Paddan Aram, in Mesopotamia. Though the biblical text itself does not attest to this, Rabbinic sources also identify him as the father of Bilhah and Zilpah, the two concubines with whom Jacob also has children (Midrash Raba, Gen 24)Laban first appears in the Hebrew Bible in Genesis 24:29–60 as the grown spokesman for his father Bethuel's house; he was impressed by the gold jewelry given to his sister on behalf of Isaac, and played a key part in arranging their marriage. Twenty years later, Laban's nephew Jacob was born to Isaac and Rebekah.When grown, Jacob comes to work for Laban. The Biblical narrative provides a framework for dating these events: Jacob begat Joseph 14 years after his flight to Laban; Joseph entered Pharaoh's service at age 30; and from that point, after seven years of plenty and two years of famine, Jacob met Pharaoh and stated his age as 130. Subtracting yields an age of 77 (Jacob at his flight to Laban). Laban was more than 30 years older than Jacob, and employed him for 20 years.Laban promised his younger daughter Rachel to Jacob in return for seven years' service, only to trick him into marrying his elder daughter Leah instead. Jacob then served another seven years in exchange for the right to marry his choice, Rachel, as well (Genesis 29). Laban's flocks and fortunes increased under Jacob's skilled care, but there was much further trickery between them. Six years after his promised service has ended, Jacob, having prospered largely by proving more cunning than his father-in-law, finally left. Laban pursued him, but they eventually parted on good terms (Genesis 31).Laban can be seen as symbolizing those whose concern for the welfare of their immediate family, nominally a virtue, is taken to the point where it has lasting negative ramifications. Laban's urge to ensure his older daughter not be left unmarried can be interpreted as leading to the Exile in Egypt; his anxiety over seeing his son-in-law throw away his family's comfortable position in Aram in search of a risky new beginning back in Canaan leads him to oppose the return of the Children of Israel to the Promised Land.[1] His name can also be seen as symbolic in this matter: it means \"white\", the visual representation of purity, without visible stain, symbolizing those without apparent evil motives whose actions nevertheless result in undesirable outcomes.Laban is referenced significantly in the Passover Haggadah, in the context of the answer to the traditional child's question, \"Why is this night different from all other nights?\" The prescribed answer begins with a quote from Deuteronomy 26:5: \"arami oved avi\": normally translated as \"a wandering Aramean was my father\", alluding either to Abram or Jacob, but here interpreted unusually as \"ibad arami et-avi\", \"an Aramean destroyed my father\", as made clear by the rabbinical exegesis read in the Seder:There may also be a play on words here, using arami in two senses – as both arami, \"an Aramean\", and rama′i, \"a deceiver\", since Laban cheated Jacob (Genesis Rabbah 70:19). In this interpretation, arami personifies the Israelite peoplesꞌs bitter enemy.[2]The question of what the connection is between the apparently disjoint tales of Laban and Pharaoh is interpreted in several ways by rabbinical authorities.Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer explains in his Hukkat HaPesach that Laban was, in fact, the primum mobile of the entire Exile and Exodus saga. Rachel was Jacob's divinely intended wife and could hypothetically have given birth to Joseph as Jacob's firstborn with rights of primogeniture. In this counterfactual, Jacob's favoring Joseph's succession as the leader of the fledging nation of Israel would have been seen as perfectly normal and fitting, given the customs of the time. No older brothers would have felt cheated and jealous, and Joseph would not have been sold into slavery. Thus, there would have been no need for Jacob's family to be sent to Egypt to unite with Joseph.In actuality, Laban married Jacob to Leah first, causing Leah's sons to precede Joseph in birth order, so that they felt justifiably outraged when their father seemed to violate societal norms by treating his youngest son as his heir, in preference to his older sons' natural and legal rights. In this way, Laban can be seen as \"seeking to uproot all\", by attempting to sever the family tree of the Patriarchs between Jacob and Joseph before the Children of Israel could become more than a single small family.Devora Steinmetz, Assistant Professor of Talmud at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, says that the story of Jacob and Laban also resonates with the covenant with Abraham, more frequently interpreted as applying to the Exodus: \"your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them and they shall afflict them ... Afterward they shall come out with great wealth\" (Genesis 15:13–16). Jacob lived in the strange land of Aram, served Laban, and was afflicted by him; then he left with great wealth and returned to the Promised Land. The story thus serves to reinforce one of the central messages of the Passover Haggadah; that the Old Testament cycle of exile, persecution and return recurs again and again, and links the observant Jew in the Diaspora to the Land of Israel.","path":[33265,-9.858925,51.64316,32977,-9.861667,51.64649,32595,-9.878424,51.64483,32416,-9.890235,51.64349,32257,-9.900772,51.64161,32106,-9.907732,51.64375,31966,-9.907672,51.64813,31775,-9.905922,51.64939,31645,-9.90493,51.64939,31116,-9.904605,51.64936,29846,-9.904634,51.64936,28497,-9.90461,51.64939,27186,-9.90463,51.64937,25907,-9.904618,51.64938,24546,-9.904609,51.64939,23215,-9.904632,51.64936,21906,-9.904616,51.64936,20567,-9.904618,51.64937,19307,-9.90462,51.64937,18027,-9.904613,51.64936,16695,-9.904618,51.64938,15316,-9.904605,51.64937,14066,-9.904602,51.64936,12745,-9.904618,51.64937,11457,-9.904578,51.64937,10196,-9.904609,51.64937,8807,-9.904605,51.64936,7406,-9.9046,51.64936,6106,-9.904616,51.64937,4797,-9.90461,51.64937,3436,-9.904592,51.64936,2095,-9.9046,51.64936,776,-9.904609,51.64938]},{"name":"DILLON OWEN","text":"DILLON OWEN:Dillon is a surname of Irish origin but with Breton-Norman roots. It is first recorded in Ireland with the arrival of Sir Henry de Leon (c.1176 – 1244), of a cadet branch of Viscounty of Léon, Brittany. He arrived in Ireland accompanying Prince John (later King John) of England. The name evolved into the Irish-language \"Diolun\"/English-language \"Dillon\" (not to be confused with the Welsh given name Dylan). It is particularly common in the Meath and Westmeath counties of Ireland where the Dillons were granted vast areas of land. The name is now widespread throughout Ireland. The Dillon family later became the Barons Clonbrock and Earls of Roscommon.","path":[40177,-10.49137,51.5526,39658,-10.45608,51.55208,39498,-10.44533,51.55197,39278,-10.43062,51.55178,38417,-10.37337,51.5511,38218,-10.3602,51.55095,38037,-10.34818,51.55073,37878,-10.33762,51.55052,37718,-10.32705,51.55028,37557,-10.31623,51.55003,37397,-10.30552,51.54984,37238,-10.2949,51.54968,37088,-10.285,51.54953,36938,-10.27507,51.54942,36778,-10.26448,51.54932,36577,-10.25118,51.5493,36057,-10.21678,51.5501,35878,-10.20497,51.5512,35717,-10.19437,51.55217,35498,-10.17993,51.55347,35318,-10.16815,51.55467,34837,-10.13655,51.55785,34597,-10.12088,51.55935,34447,-10.11113,51.56033,34278,-10.10017,51.56143,34128,-10.09047,51.56245,33978,-10.08095,51.56395,33829,-10.0718,51.5661,33688,-10.06318,51.56812,33547,-10.05437,51.5701,33397,-10.04513,51.57221,33247,-10.03593,51.5743,33108,-10.0273,51.57628,32967,-10.01863,51.57827,32828,-10.01008,51.5803,32678,-10.00091,51.58255,32527,-9.99165,51.58488,32387,-9.982984,51.58705,32229,-9.9732,51.58941,32080,-9.964033,51.59167,31938,-9.956183,51.59477,31779,-9.947534,51.5983,31638,-9.939966,51.60158,31504,-9.933583,51.60545,31297,-9.9267,51.61315,30897,-9.917833,51.62903,30748,-9.913415,51.63453,30609,-9.909384,51.64003,30404,-9.9069,51.64865,30057,-9.906281,51.6486,28697,-9.906281,51.64862,27329,-9.90625,51.64863,27209,-9.905882,51.64878,26959,-9.9058,51.64882,25657,-9.9058,51.64882,24339,-9.9058,51.64882,23027,-9.905833,51.6488,21687,-9.905817,51.64882,20348,-9.905817,51.64882,19124,-9.906384,51.6492,18989,-9.908016,51.64648,18857,-9.908517,51.64345,18699,-9.909917,51.63982,18548,-9.9126,51.63603,18408,-9.915033,51.63243,18259,-9.917566,51.62867,18118,-9.920065,51.62505,17959,-9.922983,51.62075,17598,-9.930767,51.61167,17378,-9.935449,51.60629,17228,-9.938666,51.60257,17088,-9.941667,51.5991,16947,-9.944748,51.59563,16808,-9.947667,51.59222,16647,-9.951134,51.5883,16508,-9.954083,51.58488,16359,-9.957334,51.58121,16218,-9.960917,51.5771,16077,-9.965083,51.57235,15918,-9.969767,51.567,15759,-9.974433,51.56161,15608,-9.978867,51.55651,15397,-9.985117,51.54943,15248,-9.9895,51.54443,15097,-9.993865,51.53937,14958,-9.9979,51.53473,14778,-10.00315,51.52873,14557,-10.00953,51.5214,14398,-10.01412,51.51617,14238,-10.01875,51.51088,14087,-10.02305,51.5059,13938,-10.02732,51.50098,13798,-10.03135,51.49638,13648,-10.03565,51.49147,13498,-10.03992,51.48653,13347,-10.0443,51.48155,13197,-10.04863,51.47657,13047,-10.05297,51.47157,12897,-10.05735,51.46657,12748,-10.06167,51.4616,12609,-10.06577,51.45693,12468,-10.06988,51.45221,12308,-10.07455,51.44687,12148,-10.07918,51.44152,12008,-10.08327,51.43685,11857,-10.0876,51.43181,11699,-10.09217,51.42657,11538,-10.09682,51.42125,11378,-10.1014,51.416,11217,-10.10603,51.41068,11058,-10.11058,51.40545,10838,-10.11685,51.39817,10678,-10.12155,51.39283,10528,-10.12593,51.3878,10377,-10.13042,51.38271,10208,-10.13537,51.37697,10057,-10.13983,51.37185,9898,-10.14448,51.36647,9698,-10.15033,51.3597,9518,-10.15563,51.35361,9358,-10.16032,51.34827,9038,-10.1696,51.33757,8337,-10.18985,51.31427]},{"name":"BOY JASON","text":"BOY JASON:David Jason. Sir David John White, OBE (born 2 February 1940), better known by his stage name David Jason, is an English actor and comedian. He played Derek \"Del Boy\" Trotter in the long-running BBC comedy series Only Fools and Horses, and Detective Inspector Jack Frost on the ITV crime drama A Touch of Frost.Other high-profile television roles were as Granville in the sitcom Open All Hours, and Pop Larkin in the comedy drama The Darling Buds of May as well as the voices of Mr. Toad in The Wind in the Willows, Danger Mouse and Count Duckula. His last original appearance as Del Boy was in 2014, while Jason retired his role as Frost in 2010.One of the best loved actors in British popular culture, in September 2006 Jason topped the poll to find TV's 50 Greatest Stars, as part of ITV's 50th anniversary celebrations.[2] He was knighted in 2005 for services to drama. Jason has won four British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs), (1988, 1991, 1997, 2003), four British Comedy Awards (1990, 1992, 1997, 2001) and six National Television Awards (1997, 2001, 2002 twice).Early Life: Jason's father, Arthur R White, was a porter at Billingsgate Fish Market, and his Welsh mother, Olwen Jones, worked as a charwoman. She gave birth to twin boys in Edmonton, London in February 1940, but Jason's twin brother died during childbirth, making him a twinless twin.[1] It is an urban myth that he chose the name Jason as a tribute to his dead twin:[3] David Jason himself has denied this. In 1984, during an interview on TV-am, David Jason admitted that the name David Jason was taken from his like of Jason and the Argonauts, as the stage name David White had already been taken.Jason's elder brother is the actor Arthur White, born in 1933. The two appeared together in the crime drama A Touch of Frost, with Arthur playing police archivist Ernie Trigg; and again in 2008, in the comic fantasy, The Colour of Magic, where Arthur starred as a character called \"Rerpf\". He also appeared briefly with his brother in an episode of The Darling Buds of May. On leaving school, Jason wanted to follow in his brother's footsteps as an actor, but their father insisted that he first get a trade. So, for six years, he trained as an electrician, before giving up his girlfriend at the time, and becoming a jobbing actor. Jason also has a sister, June, seven years his junior.","path":[49919,-10.88583,52.27427,49561,-10.877,52.26125,48869,-10.85917,52.23603,48710,-10.85496,52.23018,48549,-10.85083,52.22428,48359,-10.84594,52.21723,48029,-10.8372,52.20512,47869,-10.83303,52.1992,47639,-10.82713,52.19068,47480,-10.82311,52.18472,47310,-10.81893,52.17837,47170,-10.8154,52.17309,47050,-10.81235,52.16849,46830,-10.80678,52.16014,46590,-10.80075,52.151,46440,-10.79685,52.14541,46249,-10.79196,52.13825,46109,-10.78836,52.13291,45969,-10.78487,52.12764,45811,-10.78086,52.1216,45631,-10.77637,52.11481,45480,-10.77261,52.10918,45389,-10.77039,52.10583,45150,-10.76451,52.09694,42580,-10.68639,52.00516,42391,-10.67865,51.99911,42250,-10.67284,51.99463,42091,-10.66627,51.98958,41950,-10.66023,51.9851,41801,-10.65383,51.98041,41661,-10.64799,51.97594,41420,-10.63782,51.96825,41160,-10.62679,51.95992,40880,-10.61509,51.95093,39930,-10.5756,51.92059,39731,-10.56751,51.91424,39491,-10.5578,51.90651,39359,-10.55245,51.90231,39191,-10.54547,51.89685,39059,-10.54009,51.89262,38580,-10.52041,51.87722,38390,-10.51241,51.87121,38061,-10.49861,51.86075,37880,-10.49101,51.85499,37719,-10.48459,51.84958,37561,-10.47896,51.84383,37400,-10.47331,51.83811,37261,-10.46842,51.83308,37110,-10.4631,51.8278,36971,-10.45824,51.82282,36821,-10.45311,51.81755,36670,-10.44802,51.81225,36540,-10.44353,51.80767,36400,-10.43914,51.80264,36241,-10.43453,51.79676,35859,-10.42314,51.78247,35709,-10.41853,51.77699,35490,-10.41174,51.76897,35330,-10.40676,51.76321,35180,-10.40193,51.75775,35041,-10.39751,51.7527,34921,-10.39396,51.74822,34711,-10.38746,51.74055,34579,-10.38328,51.7358,34410,-10.37784,51.72961,34251,-10.37274,51.72373,34091,-10.36771,51.71786,33940,-10.36299,51.71234,33790,-10.35832,51.70693,33639,-10.35295,51.70161,33491,-10.34838,51.69621,33331,-10.34362,51.69036,33190,-10.33939,51.68528,33040,-10.33488,51.67985,32901,-10.33064,51.67477,32741,-10.32577,51.669,32580,-10.32085,51.66328,32429,-10.31622,51.65787,32290,-10.31193,51.65284,32129,-10.30695,51.64711,31989,-10.30255,51.64207,31770,-10.29549,51.63414,31630,-10.29091,51.62906,31471,-10.28564,51.62342,31310,-10.28041,51.61785,31169,-10.27578,51.61285,31029,-10.27131,51.60782,30870,-10.26602,51.60227,30721,-10.261,51.59701,30581,-10.25634,51.59195,30074,-10.23997,51.57439,29940,-10.23216,51.57263,29789,-10.22247,51.57215,29631,-10.21223,51.57222,29480,-10.2026,51.57213,29250,-10.18756,51.57181,29110,-10.17839,51.5717,28961,-10.1686,51.5716,28819,-10.15949,51.57158,28664,-10.14878,51.57177,28501,-10.13926,51.5729,28360,-10.13032,51.5739,28210,-10.12074,51.5751,27971,-10.10524,51.57689,27811,-10.09496,51.57809,27660,-10.08524,51.57919,27520,-10.07635,51.58009,27371,-10.06686,51.58107,27221,-10.05711,51.58209,27080,-10.04784,51.58314,26950,-10.03948,51.58405,26739,-10.02612,51.5857,26599,-10.01775,51.58775,26371,-10.00434,51.5915,26230,-9.996017,51.59381,26090,-9.987595,51.59611,25941,-9.97879,51.59857,25800,-9.970484,51.60093,25659,-9.962203,51.60323,25511,-9.953386,51.60563,25369,-9.945,51.60798,25220,-9.935985,51.61043,25080,-9.92899,51.61384,24749,-9.919848,51.62552,24601,-9.91611,51.63079,24459,-9.912382,51.63589,24311,-9.908915,51.64144,24173,-9.908069,51.64645,23970,-9.906257,51.64863,22620,-9.906259,51.64861,21310,-9.906261,51.6486,21180,-9.906183,51.64911,21060,-9.907244,51.6506,20820,-9.908095,51.65107,19531,-9.908038,51.65105,18220,-9.908049,51.65107,16919,-9.908067,51.65105,15531,-9.908045,51.65105,14171,-9.908029,51.65106,12910,-9.908067,51.65111,11629,-9.907989,51.65104,10301,-9.907973,51.65105,8999,-9.908103,51.65102,7730,-9.908047,51.65108,6370,-9.908116,51.65099,5010,-9.907965,51.65114,3729,-9.908069,51.65105,2320,-9.908015,51.65107,1020,-9.908085,51.65104]},{"name":"TWISTER","text":"TWISTER:Twister may refer to:Twister may also refer to:A tornado.

She replaced Stena Nordica on the route in March 2015. The ferry was refurbished in Gdańsk, Poland for her new service and was returned to her original design before her SeaFrance career and looks identical to her sisters Stena Superfast VII & VIII. Before November 2014 she operated between Dover and Calais for DFDS Seaways France and between 2008 and 2012 for SeaFrance.Concept and construction.The Superfast X was the last ship in a series of four identical ice classed fast ferries built by HDW for Superfast Ferries' new Baltic Sea services. She was launched on 18 November 2000, on the same date as her sisters Superfast VII[7] and Superfast IXThe Superfast X was delivered to her owners on 26 February 2002 and christened on the same date by Patricia Lederer, wife of the HDW project director for the Superfast ships.Service history. The Superfast X entered service for Superfast Ferries on 27 February 2002 on the Hanko–Rostock route. She remained on that route until 19 April 2002, when she was laid up in Kiel at HDW. On 17 May 2002, she re-entered service, on the Rosyth–Zeebrugge route. In January and February 2004, the Superfast X was rebuilt at Fosen Mekaniske Verksted, Fosen, Norway with additional passenger berths.[2] On 7 August 2006, Superfast Ferries announced it had sold the Superfast X to Veolia Transport for Euro 112 million.[10] The ship was delivered to her new owners on 12 February 2007 and renamed Jean Nicoli.In March 2007, the Jean Nicoli made crossings from Le Havre to Marseille,[citation needed] carrying cars on board. During April the same year, she was chartered to COTUNAV for traffic from Italy and France to Tunisia. At the end of April she was laid up, initially at La Seyne, later at Marseille. From 8 September until 2 October 2007 she was chartered to ANEK Lines for service on its Patras–Corfu–Igoumenitsa–Venice route.[2] On 27 December 2007, the ship was sold to SeaFrance.In the beginning of April 2008, the Jean Nicoli was delivered to SeaFrance and renamed SeaFrance Molière. On 3 April 2008, she left Marseille for Arno Dunkerque for rebuilding into a short distance ferry.[2][5][11] After transfer to the leasing company Sarl Poquelin Bail, she entered service with SeaFrance in freight only operation on 19 August 2008 and began passenger service on 1 September 2008.From 16 November 2011, she was laid up, initially at Dunkerque, due to the commercial court ordering that Seafrance be liquidated, and, following its sale, at Tilbury in England.In October 2012, DFDS chartered the ship to be used on its Dover–Dunkerque crossing.[13] During a short refit by Arno at Dunkerque she was renamed Dieppe Seaways and returned to the French registry. She re-entered service on 7 November though, following a change of plan, on the Dover-Calais route.On 1 May 2014, the Dieppe Seaways suffered a fire from an overheated boiler in the engine room as she approached Dover from Calais. All 316 passengers disembarked safely on arrival. However, in responding to the fire, seven crew members and three firefighters were injured with flash burns.At the end of her charter to DFDS Seaways in November 2014, Stena Line took possession of the vessel returning her to her original name, albeit with a Stena prefix, and sending her for an extensive refit to return the cargo arrangements to their original configuration and refurbish the interiors similar to sisterships MS Stena Superfast VII and MS Stena Superfast VIII operating on the Cairnryan (Loch Ryan) to Belfast route.[1] After refit the ship replaced MS Stena Nordica (which

(uppercase Ε, lowercase ε or lunate ϵ; Greek: Έψιλον) is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, corresponding phonetically to a mid front unrounded vowel /e/. In the system of Greek numerals it has the value five. It was derived from the Phoenician letter He . Letters that arose from epsilon include the Roman E, Ë and Ɛ, and Cyrillic Е, È, Ё, Є and Э.The name of the letter was originally εἶ (Ancient Greek: [êː]), but the name was changed to ἒ ψιλόν (e psilon \"simple e\") in the Middle Ages to distinguish the letter from the digraph αι, a former diphthong that had come to be pronounced the same as epsilon.In essence, the uppercase form of epsilon looks identical to Latin E. The lowercase version has two typographical variants, both inherited from medieval Greek handwriting. One, the most common in modern typography and inherited from medieval minuscule, looks like a reversed \"3\". The other, also known as lunate or uncial epsilon and inherited from earlier uncial writing,[1][2] looks like a semicircle crossed by a horizontal bar. While in normal typography these are just alternative font variants, they may have different meanings as mathematical symbols. Computer systems therefore offer distinct encodings for them.[1] In Unicode, the character U+0一3F5 \"Greek lunate epsilon symbol\" (ϵ) is provided specifically for the lunate form. In TeX, \\epsilon (                        ϵ                          {\\displaystyle \\epsilon \\!}    ) denotes the lunate form, while \\varepsilon (                        ε                          {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon \\!}    ) denotes the reversed-3 form.There is also a Latin epsilon or \"open e\", which looks similar to the Greek lowercase epsilon. It is encoded in Unicode as U+025B (\"Latin small-letter open e\", ɛ) and U+0190 (\"Latin capital-letter open e\", Ɛ) and is used as an IPA phonetic symbol. The lunate or uncial epsilon has also provided inspiration for the euro sign (€).The lunate epsilon (ϵ) is not to be confused with the set membership symbol (∈); nor should the Latin uppercase epsilon (Ɛ) be confused with the Greek uppercase sigma (Σ). The symbol                         ∈                 {\\displaystyle \\in }    , first used in set theory and logic by Giuseppe Peano and now used in mathematics in general for set membership (\"belongs to\") , did, however, evolve from the letter epsilon, since the symbol was originally used as an abbreviation for the Latin word \"est\". In addition, mathematicians have read the symbol                         ∈                 {\\displaystyle \\in }     as \"element of\", as in \"1 is an element of the natural numbers\" for                         1         ∈                    N                          {\\displaystyle 1\\in \\mathbb {N} }    , for example. As late as 1960,                         ϵ                 {\\displaystyle \\epsilon }     itself was used for set membership, while its negation \"does not belong to\" (now                         ∉                 {\\displaystyle \\notin }    ) was denoted by                                    ϵ           ′                          {\\displaystyle \\epsilon '}     (epsilon prime).[3] Only gradually did a fully separate stylized symbol take the place of epsilon. In a related context, Peano also introduced the use of a backwards epsilon,                         ∍                 {\\displaystyle \\backepsilon }    , for the phrase \"such that\", although the abbreviation \"s.t.\" has gradually supplanted                         ∍                 {\\displaystyle \\backepsilon }     in general usage.The letter Ε was taken over from the Phoenician letter He () when Greeks first adopted alphabetic writing. In archaic Greek writing, its shape is often still identical to that of the Phoenician letter. Like other Greek letters, it could face either leftward or rightward (), depending on the current writing direction, but, just like in Phoenician, the horizontal bars always faced in the direction of writing. Archaic writing often preserves the Phoenician form with a vertical stem extending slightly below the lowest horizontal bar. In the classical era, through the influence of more cursive writing styles, the shape was simplified to the current E glyph.[4]While the original pronunciation of the Phoenician letter He was [h], the earliest Greek sound value of Ε was determined by the vowel occurring in the Phoenician letter name, which made it a natural choice for being reinterpreted from a consonant symbol to a vowel symbol denoting an [e] sound.[5] Besides its classical Greek sound value, the short /e/ phoneme, it could initially also be used for other [e]-like sounds. For instance, in early Attic before c.500 B.C., it was used also both for the long, open /ɛː/, and for the long close /eː/. In the former role, it was later replaced in the classic Greek alphabet by Eta (Η), which was taken over from eastern Ionic alphabets, while in the latter role it was replaced by the digraph spelling ΕΙ.Some dialects used yet other ways of distinguishing between various e-like sounds.In Corinth, the normal function of Ε to denote /e/ and /ɛː/ was taken by a glyph resembling a pointed B (), while Ε was used only for long close /eː/.[6] The letter Beta, in turn, took the deviant shape .In Sicyon, a variant glyph resembling an X () was used in the same function as Corinthian .[7]In Thespiai (Boeotia), a special letter form consisting of a vertical stem with a single rightward-pointing horizontal bar () was used for what was probably a raised variant of /e/ in pre-vocalic environments.[8][9] This tack glyph was used elsewhere also as a form of \"Heta\", i.e. for the sound /h/.After the establishment of the canonical classic Greek alphabet[clarify], new glyph variants for Ε were introduced through handwriting. In the uncial script (used for literary papyrus manuscripts in late antiquity and then in early medieval vellum codices), the \"lunate\" shape () became predominant. In cursive handwriting, a large number of shorthand glyphs came to be used, where the cross-bar and the curved stroke were linked in various ways.[10] Some of them resembled a modern lowercase Latin \"e\", some a \"6\" with a connecting stroke to the next letter starting from the middle, and some a combination of two small \"c\"-like curves. Several of these shapes were later taken over into minuscule book hand. Of the various minuscule letter shapes, the inverted-3 form became the basis for lower-case Epsilon in Greek typography during the modern era.Despite its pronunciation as mid, in the International Phonetic Alphabet, the Latin epsilon /ɛ/ represents open-mid front unrounded vowel, as in the English word \"pet\" /ˈpɛt/.The uppercase Epsilon is not commonly used outside of the Greek language because of its similarity to the Latin letter E.The Greek lowercase epsilon ε, the lunate epsilon symbol ϵ, or the Latin lowercase epsilon ɛ (see above) is used as the symbol for:These characters are used only as mathematical symbols.

Recorded in east London's Miloco Studios with producers James Ford and Mike Crossey, the album was preceded by the release of \"Brianstorm\" on 16 April 2007.Change of style[edit] In comparison to the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, the album has been described as \"very, very fast and very, very loud,\"[7] being seen as \"more ambitious, heavier...and with a fiercely bright production\". Reflecting the band's travels around the world more than local stories of the first record, FWN is a \"faster, meaner\" album.[9] The album arguably has influences from The Smiths - \"twanging, quasi-ambient backdrops...and Turner's voice [...] crooning like Morrissey or Richard Hawley.\"[8] Matt Helders said \"James was DJing loads in the evening so we'd go out and . . . have a dance.\" As a result, the drum rhythms of Helders and bassist Nick O'Malley have drawn comparisons to the Eighties funk band ESG.The band's love of classic films also influences their new style. For example, the organ at the beginning of the album's final track, \"505\" is taken directly from Ennio Morricone's soundtrack for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (where Angel Eyes enters before the final standoff).History of the album. The album title, \"Favourite Worst Nightmare\", came from the song \"D is for Dangerous\", the third song featured on the album. The band said they also considered naming the album Lesbian Wednesdays, Gordon Brown or Gary Barlow\". In an interview with NME, Nick O'Malley announced several titles including \"D is for Dangerous\" and \"Balaclava\". The tracks \"The Bakery\" and \"Plastic Tramp\" also mentioned in the NME interview did not make it onto the album, but were later released as B-sides on the \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" single. The track \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\" was also rumoured for inclusion, though it didn't make it. 6 of the 12 songs were debuted at gigs before they released the album. The album was recorded quickly as the band wanted to get out and play the songs again.Critical reception: Favourite Worst Nightmare has received universal acclaim since release, with a score of 82 on Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews.[11] In a 5-star review, The Daily Express described it as \"a shockingly good release that just gets better, faster and stronger with each listen\",while The Guardian said it had \"successfully negotiated the daunting task of following up the biggest-selling debut album in British history\" and stated that the second half of the album was the stronger half, noting the similarity to Morrissey in \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" whilst criticising the opening tracks, Brianstorm in particular. Their progression was also highlighted with The Guardian saying \"if you removed everything from the album except Matt Helders' drumming, it would still be a pretty gripping listen\",and The Observer praising the new sounds on the album referencing the \"piercing, melodic guitar by Jamie Cook\" and \"where Turner reveals the other weapons in his armoury\" when referring to Alex Turner's progression.Pitchfork Media noticed the \"new emotional depth\" of tracks such as \"Do Me a Favour\", \"Only Ones Who Know\" and \"505\",which were also commonly cited by most other critics as being

page \"NORBANK\" does not exist. Norbana (gens)The gens Norbana was a plebeian family at Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned toward the beginning of the first century BC, and from then to the end of the second century AD they filled a number of magistracies and other important posts, first in the late Republic, and subsequently under the emperors.Origin: Because the great majority of Roman gentilicia end in -ius, many writers have supposed Norbanus to have been a cognomen, perhaps belonging to a branch of the Junia gens. In fact, it is itself a nomen gentilicium, belonging to a class of nomina derived from place-names, and ending in -anus.[1][2] Such names were common in families of Umbrian origin, although less characteristic of Latin gentes.[3] In the case of the Norbani, the name is derived from the town of Norba, in Latium.Branches and cognomina.

is the Latin name for Odysseus, a hero in ancient Greek literature.Ulysses may also refer to a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920, and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday. It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature,[1] and has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement\".[2] According to Declan Kiberd, \"Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking.\"[3]\n\nUlysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904.[4][5] Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early twentieth century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland's relationship to Britain. The novel imitates registers of centuries of English literature and is highly allusive.\n\nUlysses is approximately 265,000 words in length[6] and is divided into eighteen episodes. Since publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from early obscenity trials to protracted textual \"Joyce Wars\". Ulysses' stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose — full of puns, parodies, and allusions — as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour, have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works ever written. Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday.Joyce first encountered the figure of Odysseus/Ulysses in Charles Lamb's Adventures of Ulysses—an adaptation of the Odyssey for children, which seemed to establish the Roman name in Joyce's mind. At school he wrote an essay on the character, entitled \"My Favourite Hero\".[7][8] Joyce told Frank Budgen that he considered Ulysses the only all-round character in literature.[9] He thought about calling his short-story collection Dubliners by the name Ulysses in Dublin,[10] but the idea grew from a story in Dubliners in 1906, to a \"short book\" in 1907,[11] to the vast novel that he began in 1914.Joyce divided Ulysses into 18 episodes. At first glance much of the book may appear unstructured and chaotic; Joyce once said that he had \"put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant\", which would earn the novel immortality.[17] The two schemata which Stuart Gilbert and Herbert Gorman released after publication to defend Joyce from the obscenity accusations made the links to the Odyssey clear, and also explained the work's internal structure.\nEvery episode of Ulysses has a theme, technique and correspondence between its characters and those of the Odyssey. The original text did not include these episode titles and the correspondences; instead, they originate from the Linati and Gilbert schemata. Joyce referred to the episodes by their Homeric titles in his letters.

PILOT","text":"LIFFEY PILOT:The Liffey Swim, currently titled the Dublin City Liffey Swim, is an annual race in Dublin's main river, the Liffey, and is one of Ireland's most famous traditional sporting events. The race is managed by a voluntary not-for-profit organisation, Leinster Open Sea. The 97th Liffey Swim took place on Saturday 6 August 2016, starting at the Rory O’Moore Bridge (Watling Street Bridge) beside the Guinness Brewery.The race is one of the last swims in a season of 30 open sea races held during the summer months, organised by Leinster Open Sea, and takes place usually on a Saturday in either late August or early September. Entrants to the Liffey Swim must complete six qualifying open sea races from the annual Leinster Open Sea Calendar (up from four pre-2015). Many levels and ages of swimmers compete in the race, but entrants must be a member of a swimming club. International competitors are common. The race is handicapped with the slowest swimmers starting first and the fastest last. In 2016 267 men and 147 women took part in the 97th Liffey Swim. For five years between 1934 and 1938, the Liffey Swim was run as a scratch race.Course:The race starts at Rory O'More Bridge near the Guinness Brewery and takes competitors past landmarks such as the Four Courts. The competitors swim under James Joyce Bridge, Mellows Bridge, Father Mathew Bridge, O'Donovan Rossa Bridge, Grattan Bridge, Millenium Bridge, Liffey Bridge, O'Connell Bridge, Rosie Hackett Bridge, Butt Bridge and Loopline Bridge near The Custom House.[2] Average entry is 200 males and 80 females. Wetsuits are not allowed. The race is held in the tidal section of the river meaning it is flushed twice daily. Due to the tidal nature of the Liffey, race times vary from year to year.For four years 1936—1939, the Liffey Swim took place from Bull Wall to Dollymount Strand (in 1939 to Clontarf Baths) because of the degree of pollution of the course stretch of the River Liffey.[1] For the three years 1977—1979, again because of the risks to health caused by pollution, the race was moved to an upstream stretch of the river near Chapelizod, finishing at the slipway of Dublin University Boat House, at Memorial Park, Islandbridge.Due to the development of the LUAS Bridge, the Rosie Hackett Bridge, from Hawkins Street to Malborough Street, the race diverged from the historic route in 2012 and 2013 starting at the Loopline Bridge beside Butt Bridge and finishing at the pontoon on the North side of the river beside the East Link Bridge in front of the 3Arena. At approx. 1,600 metres it was somewhat shorter than the more spectator friendly route down the Liffey and under its numerous bridges.","path":[72201,-6.150687,53.34403,71934,-6.103398,53.34586,65140,-6.20352,53.34462,64901,-6.21163,53.34501,64391,-6.215425,53.3476,64213,-6.21524,53.34777,58783,-6.168947,53.34387,58482,-6.125463,53.33364,55420,-6.204134,53.34652,54878,-6.204342,53.34575,54430,-6.204134,53.34642,54131,-6.176538,53.34375,53770,-6.119923,53.33724,53590,-6.092647,53.33055,52271,-6.144597,53.34361,51673,-6.187531,53.34436,51492,-6.196207,53.34439,48143,-6.204088,53.34695,44478,-6.204095,53.34519,44088,-6.159562,53.34339,41960,-6.126382,53.33276,30579,-6.208628,53.3448,28386,-6.198431,53.34377,28176,-6.16671,53.34397,27816,-6.11508,53.34251,26977,-6.175238,53.34389,23861,-6.188235,53.344,23561,-6.142977,53.34301,23322,-6.106493,53.34089,21462,-6.203495,53.34455,16677,-6.203863,53.34341,8306,-6.195985,53.34374,8125,-6.168503,53.34387,8005,-6.149865,53.34354,7764,-6.112813,53.34168]},{"name":"STENA ADVENTURER","text":"STENA ADVENTURER:Stena Adventurer is a large roll on/roll off passenger (ro-pax) ferry operated by Stena Line on its Holyhead - Dublin route.

KELT (FM), call letters of a FM radio station located in Encinal, Texas. KELT, the former call letters of a FM radio station located in Adelanto, California. Kelt is the name of a beer found in Slovakia and the Czech Republic.\nThe NATO Reporting Name (AS-5 Kelt) for the Raduga KSR-2 cruise missile formerly used by the armed forces of the Soviet Union. The acronym for Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope, an astronomical survey for transiting exoplanets, or the planets discovered by the KELT survey, such as KELT-2Ab is an extrasolar planet that orbits the star KELT-2A approximately 419 light-years away in the constellation of Auriga.[1] It was discovered by the KELT-North survey via the transit method, so both its mass and radius are known quite precisely. As of its discovery KELT-2Ab is the fifth-brightest transiting Hot Jupiter known that has a well constrained mass. This makes the KELT-2A system a promising target for future space- and ground-based follow-up observations to learn about the planet's atmosphere. The star KELT-2A is a member of the common-proper-motion binary star system KELT-2 (HD 42176). KELT-2B is an early K dwarf approximately 295 astronomical units away.","path":[82641,-5.655965,53.90888,82492,-5.659905,53.90236,82302,-5.664883,53.89412,82152,-5.668847,53.88758,82022,-5.672245,53.88194,81892,-5.675628,53.87631,81742,-5.679542,53.86982,81591,-5.683438,53.86329,81401,-5.688357,53.85505,81211,-5.693222,53.84685,81052,-5.697237,53.83999,80852,-5.702233,53.83136,80710,-5.70584,53.82523,80562,-5.709577,53.81886,80371,-5.714415,53.81063,80231,-5.717938,53.80459,80100,-5.72116,53.79892,79892,-5.726427,53.78996,79752,-5.729962,53.78396,79622,-5.733272,53.77841,79491,-5.736543,53.77283,79290,-5.741601,53.76429,79161,-5.744855,53.75883,79022,-5.748325,53.75293,78812,-5.753553,53.74402,78662,-5.757262,53.73767,78541,-5.76028,53.73253,78392,-5.764025,53.72623,78241,-5.767765,53.71983,78041,-5.77271,53.71137,77902,-5.776205,53.70546,77742,-5.780142,53.69869,77592,-5.783812,53.69235,77451,-5.787288,53.68639,77252,-5.792193,53.67801,77112,-5.795565,53.67208,76962,-5.799155,53.66573,76822,-5.802518,53.65981,76671,-5.806127,53.65349,76482,-5.810665,53.64555,76342,-5.814057,53.63966,76202,-5.817512,53.63379,76082,-5.820475,53.62878,75872,-5.82556,53.62002,75731,-5.82905,53.61419,75591,-5.832535,53.60839,75442,-5.836222,53.60217,75301,-5.839645,53.59637,75152,-5.843325,53.59019,75011,-5.846895,53.5844,74862,-5.85111,53.57836,74721,-5.85536,53.57271,74581,-5.859571,53.56711,74431,-5.864188,53.56113,74292,-5.868413,53.55561,74161,-5.872358,53.55043,74001,-5.877148,53.54411,73862,-5.881283,53.53861,73651,-5.887708,53.53026,73491,-5.892539,53.52393,73310,-5.897974,53.5167,73162,-5.902431,53.51079,73022,-5.906611,53.50512,72892,-5.910215,53.49989,72701,-5.915445,53.49221,72520,-5.920367,53.48495,72332,-5.925375,53.4774,72192,-5.92902,53.47189,72051,-5.9327,53.46633,71901,-5.936572,53.4604,71772,-5.939858,53.4553,71641,-5.943121,53.45012,71430,-5.948322,53.44176,71290,-5.951869,53.43624,71132,-5.955915,53.43,70992,-5.95936,53.42443,70852,-5.962821,53.41889,70661,-5.967632,53.41129,70511,-5.97149,53.40531,70362,-5.975368,53.39942,70172,-5.980613,53.39198,70032,-5.984775,53.38601,69872,-5.98985,53.37881,69742,-5.993989,53.37295,69622,-5.99773,53.36767,69442,-6.003127,53.35979,69321,-6.006603,53.35453,69182,-6.01049,53.34847,69050,-6.017793,53.34469,68891,-6.02998,53.34192,68752,-6.040365,53.33939,68591,-6.052492,53.33647,68451,-6.062968,53.33383,68301,-6.073925,53.33085,68171,-6.083955,53.33109,68012,-6.095722,53.33523,67882,-6.105445,53.3385,67741,-6.11635,53.34112,67621,-6.126137,53.34163,67472,-6.138205,53.34246,67331,-6.148859,53.34333,67182,-6.159787,53.34373,66990,-6.171617,53.34358,66841,-6.179147,53.34349,66701,-6.186198,53.34339,66531,-6.194785,53.34354,66371,-6.203222,53.34385,66211,-6.211077,53.3444,66042,-6.213405,53.34602,65231,-6.213227,53.34613,64016,-6.213198,53.34613,62036,-6.213247,53.3461,60056,-6.213252,53.34611,58076,-6.213223,53.34611,56096,-6.213192,53.34607,54296,-6.213213,53.34609,52496,-6.213207,53.3461,50516,-6.21323,53.34609,48716,-6.213225,53.34611,46736,-6.213217,53.34609,44396,-6.213245,53.3461,42775,-6.213217,53.34612,40796,-6.213253,53.34609,38635,-6.21323,53.3461,37375,-6.213228,53.34611,36115,-6.213264,53.34609,34855,-6.213237,53.34611,32875,-6.213213,53.34611,31076,-6.213232,53.34612,29815,-6.213275,53.3461,28556,-6.213243,53.34614,27115,-6.21324,53.34613,25135,-6.213213,53.3461,23875,-6.213242,53.34607,22616,-6.21322,53.34613,21355,-6.213248,53.34612,19735,-6.213247,53.34612,18475,-6.213278,53.34612,16855,-6.213228,53.34612,15595,-6.213232,53.34613,14335,-6.213228,53.34609,13075,-6.213255,53.3461,11815,-6.213225,53.34614,10555,-6.213217,53.34613,9295,-6.213228,53.34612,8035,-6.213255,53.34613,6775,-6.213247,53.3461,5515,-6.213247,53.34611,4255,-6.213242,53.34612,2995,-6.213212,53.34611,1734,-6.2132,53.34612,474,-6.21324,53.34612]},{"name":"JONATHAN SWIFT","text":"JONATHAN SWIFT:Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745) was an Anglo-Irish[1] satirist, essayist, political pamphleteer (first for the Whigs, then for the Tories), poet and cleric who became Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.[2]Swift is remembered for works such as A Tale of a Tub (1704), An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity (1712), Gulliver's Travels (1726), and A Modest Proposal (1729). He is regarded by the Encyclopædia Britannica as the foremost prose satirist in the English language,[1] and is less well known for his poetry. He originally published all of his works under pseudonyms – such as Lemuel Gulliver, Isaac Bickerstaff, Drapier's Letters as MB Drapier – or anonymously. He is also known for being a master of two styles of satire, the Horatian and Juvenalian styles.His deadpan, ironic writing style, particularly in A Modest Proposal, has led to such satire being subsequently termed \"Swiftian\".[3]Jonathan Swift was born on 30 November 1667 in Dublin, Ireland. He was the second child and only son of Jonathan Swift (1640–1667) and his wife Abigail Erick (or Herrick) of Frisby on the Wreake.[4] His father was a native of Goodrich, Herefordshire, but he accompanied his brothers to Ireland to seek their fortunes in law after their Royalist father's estate was brought to ruin during the English Civil War. Swift's father died in Dublin about seven months before he was born.[5][6] His mother returned to England after his birth, leaving him in the care of his influential uncle Godwin, a close friend and confidant of Sir John Temple whose son later employed Swift as his secretary.[7]Swift's family had several interesting literary connections. His grandmother Elizabeth (Dryden) Swift was the niece of Sir Erasmus Dryden, grandfather of poet John Dryden. The same grandmother's aunt Katherine (Throckmorton) Dryden was a first cousin of Elizabeth, wife of Sir Walter Raleigh. His great-great grandmother Margaret (Godwin) Swift was the sister of Francis Godwin, author of The Man in the Moone which influenced parts of Swift's Gulliver's Travels. His uncle Thomas Swift married a daughter of poet and playwright Sir William Davenant, a godson of William Shakespeare.Swift's benefactor and uncle Godwin Swift (1628–1695) took primary responsibility for the young man, sending him with one of his cousins to Kilkenny College (also attended by philosopher George Berkeley).[7] He attended Dublin University (Trinity College, Dublin) in 1682, financed by Godwin's son Willoughby, from which he received his B.A. in 1686 and developed his friendship with William Congreve. Swift was studying for his master's degree when political troubles in Ireland surrounding the Glorious Revolution forced him to leave for England in 1688, where his mother helped him get a position as secretary and personal assistant of Sir William Temple at Moor Park, Farnham.[8] Temple was an English diplomat who arranged the Triple Alliance of 1668. He had retired from public service to his country estate to tend his gardens and write his memoirs. Gaining his employer's confidence, Swift \"was often trusted with matters of great importance\".[9] Within three years of their acquaintance, Temple had introduced his secretary to William III and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments.Swift took up his residence at Moor Park where he met Esther Johnson, then eight years old, the daughter of an impoverished widow who acted as companion to Temple's sister Lady Giffard. Swift was her tutor and mentor, giving her the nickname \"Stella\", and the two maintained a close but ambiguous relationship for the rest of Esther's life.[10]In 1690, Swift left Temple for Ireland because of his health but returned to Moor Park the following year. The illness consisted of fits of vertigo or giddiness, now known to be Ménière's disease, and it continued to plague him throughout his life. During this second stay with Temple, Swift received his M.A. from Hart Hall, Oxford in 1692. Then he left Moor Park, apparently despairing of gaining a better position through Temple's patronage, to become an ordained priest in the Established Church of Ireland. He was appointed to the prebend of Kilroot in the Diocese of Connor in 1694, with his parish located at Kilroot, near Carrickfergus in County Antrim.Swift appears to have been miserable in his new position, being isolated in a small, remote community far from the centres of power and influence. While at Kilroot, however, he may well have become romantically involved with Jane Waring, whom he called \"Varina\", the sister of an old college friend.[9] A letter from him survives, offering to remain if she would marry him and promising to leave and never return to Ireland if she refused. She presumably refused, because Swift left his post and returned to England and Temple's service at Moor Park in 1696, and he remained there until Temple's death. There he was employed in helping to prepare Temple's memoirs and correspondence for publication. During this time, Swift wrote The Battle of the Books, a satire responding to critics of Temple's Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning (1690), though Battle was not published until 1704.Temple died on 27 January 1699.[9] Swift, normally a harsh judge of human nature, said that all that was good and amiable in mankind had died with Temple.[9] He stayed on briefly in England to complete editing Temple's memoirs, and perhaps in the hope that recognition of his work might earn him a suitable position in England. Unfortunately, his work made enemies among some of Temple's family and friends, in particular Temple's formidable sister Lady Giffard, who objected to indiscretions included in the memoirs.[10] Swift's next move was to approach King William directly, based on his imagined connection through Temple and a belief that he had been promised a position. This failed so miserably that he accepted the lesser post of secretary and chaplain to the Earl of Berkeley, one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. However, when he reached Ireland, he found that the secretaryship had already been given to another. He soon obtained the living of Laracor, Agher, and Rathbeggan, and the prebend of Dunlavin in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.[11]Swift ministered to a congregation of about 15 at Laracor, which was just over four and half miles (7.5 km) from Summerhill, County Meath and twenty miles (32 km) from Dublin. He had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden, making a canal after the Dutch fashion of Moor Park, planting willows, and rebuilding the vicarage. As chaplain to Lord Berkeley, he spent much of his time in Dublin and travelled to London frequently over the next ten years. In 1701, he anonymously published the political pamphlet A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome.Swift had residence in Trim, County Meath after 1700. He wrote many of his works during this time period. In February 1702, Swift received his Doctor of Divinity degree from Trinity College, Dublin. That spring he travelled to England and then returned to Ireland in October, accompanied by Esther Johnson—now 20—and his friend Rebecca Dingley, another member of William Temple's household. There is a great mystery and controversy over Swift's relationship with Esther Johnson, nicknamed \"Stella\". Many, notably his close friend Thomas Sheridan, believed that they were secretly married in 1716; others, like Swift's housekeeper Mrs Brent and Rebecca Dingley (who lived with Stella all through her years in Ireland) dismissed the story as absurd.[12] Swift certainly did not wish her to marry anyone else: in 1704, when their mutual friend William Tisdall informed Swift that he intended to propose to Stella, Swift wrote to him to dissuade him from the idea. Although the tone of the letter was courteous, Swift privately expressed his disgust for Tisdall as an \"interloper\", and they were estranged for many years.During his visits to England in these years, Swift published A Tale of a Tub and The Battle of the Books (1704) and began to gain a reputation as a writer. This led to close, lifelong friendships with Alexander Pope, John Gay, and John Arbuthnot, forming the core of the Martinus Scriblerus Club (founded in 1713).Swift became increasingly active politically in these years.[13] From 1707 to 1709 and again in 1710, Swift was in London unsuccessfully urging upon the Whig administration of Lord Godolphin the claims of the Irish clergy to the First-Fruits and Twentieths (\"Queen Anne's Bounty\"), which brought in about £2,500 a year, already granted to their brethren in England. He found the opposition Tory leadership more sympathetic to his cause, and, when they came to power in 1710, he was recruited to support their cause as editor of The Examiner. In 1711, Swift published the political pamphlet The Conduct of the Allies, attacking the Whig government for its inability to end the prolonged war with France. The incoming Tory government conducted secret (and illegal) negotiations with France, resulting in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) ending the War of the Spanish Succession.Swift was part of the inner circle of the Tory government,[14] and often acted as mediator between Henry St John (Viscount Bolingbroke), the secretary of state for foreign affairs (1710–15), and Robert Harley (Earl of Oxford), lord treasurer and prime minister (1711–1714). Swift recorded his experiences and thoughts during this difficult time in a long series of letters to Esther Johnson, collected and published after his death as A Journal to Stella. The animosity between the two Tory leaders eventually led to the dismissal of Harley in 1714. With the death of Queen Anne and accession of George I that year, the Whigs returned to power, and the Tory leaders were tried for treason for conducting secret negotiations with France.Also during these years in London, Swift became acquainted with the Vanhomrigh family (Dutch merchants who had settled in Ireland, then moved to London) and became involved with one of the daughters, Esther. Swift furnished Esther with the nickname \"Vanessa\" (derived by adding \"Essa\", a pet form of Esther, to the \"Van\" of her surname, Vanhomrigh), and she features as one of the main characters in his poem Cadenus and Vanessa. The poem and their correspondence suggest that Esther was infatuated with Swift, and that he may have reciprocated her affections, only to regret this and then try to break off the relationship.[15] Esther followed Swift to Ireland in 1714, and settled at her old family home, Celbridge Abbey. Their uneasy relationship continued for some years; then there appears to have been a confrontation, possibly involving Esther Johnson. Esther Vanhomrigh died in 1723 at the age of 35, having destroyed the will she had made in Swift's favour.[16] Another lady with whom he had a close but less intense relationship was Anne Long, a toast of the Kit-Cat Club.Before the fall of the Tory government, Swift hoped that his services would be rewarded with a church appointment in England. However, Queen Anne appeared to have taken a dislike to Swift and thwarted these efforts. Her dislike has been attributed to The Tale of a Tub, which she thought blasphemous, compounded by The Windsor Prophecy, where Swift, with a surprising lack of tact, advised the Queen on which of her bedchamber ladies she should and should not trust.[17] The best position his friends could secure for him was the Deanery of St Patrick's; this was not in the Queen's gift and Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, made it clear that Swift would not have received the preferment if she could have prevented it.[18] With the return of the Whigs, Swift's best move was to leave England and he returned to Ireland in disappointment, a virtual exile, to live \"like a rat in a hole\".[19]Once in Ireland, however, Swift began to turn his pamphleteering skills in support of Irish causes, producing some of his most memorable works: Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture (1720), Drapier's Letters (1724), and A Modest Proposal (1729), earning him the status of an Irish patriot.[20] This new role was unwelcome to the Government, which made clumsy attempts to silence him. His printer, Edward Waters, was convicted of seditious libel in 1720, but four years later a grand jury refused to find that the Drapier's Letters (which, though written under a pseudonym, were universally known to be Swift's work) were seditious.[21] Swift responded with an attack on the Irish judiciary almost unparalleled in its ferocity, his principal target being the \"vile and profligate villain\" William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.[22]Also during these years, he began writing his masterpiece, Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, in Four Parts, by Lemuel Gulliver, first a surgeon, and then a captain of several ships, better known as Gulliver's Travels. Much of the material reflects his political experiences of the preceding decade. For instance, the episode in which the giant Gulliver puts out the Lilliputian palace fire by urinating on it can be seen as a metaphor for the Tories' illegal peace treaty; having done a good thing in an unfortunate manner. In 1726 he paid a long-deferred visit to London,[23] taking with him the manuscript of Gulliver's Travels. During his visit he stayed with his old friends Alexander Pope, John Arbuthnot and John Gay, who helped him arrange for the anonymous publication of his book. First published in November 1726, it was an immediate hit, with a total of three printings that year and another in early 1727. French, German, and Dutch translations appeared in 1727, and pirated copies were printed in Ireland.Swift returned to England one more time in 1727 and stayed with Alexander Pope once again. The visit was cut short when Swift received word that Esther Johnson was dying, and rushed back home to be with her.[23] On 28 January 1728, Esther Johnson died; Swift had prayed at her bedside, even composing prayers for her comfort. Swift could not bear to be present at the end, but on the night of her death he began to write his The Death of Mrs Johnson. He was too ill to attend the funeral at St Patrick's.[23] Many years later, a lock of hair, assumed to be Esther Johnson's, was found in his desk, wrapped in a paper bearing the words, \"Only a woman's hair\".Death became a frequent feature of Swift's life from this point. In 1731 he wrote Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift, his own obituary published in 1739. In 1732, his good friend and collaborator John Gay died. In 1735, John Arbuthnot, another friend from his days in London, died. In 1738 Swift began to show signs of illness, and in 1742 he may have suffered a stroke, losing the ability to speak and realising his worst fears of becoming mentally disabled. (\"I shall be like that tree,\" he once said, \"I shall die at the top.\")[24] He became increasingly quarrelsome, and long-standing friendships, like that with Thomas Sheridan, ended without sufficient cause. To protect him from unscrupulous hangers on, who had begun to prey on the great man, his closest companions had him declared of \"unsound mind and memory\". However, it was long believed by many that Swift was actually insane at this point. In his book Literature and Western Man, author J. B. Priestley even cites the final chapters of Gulliver's Travels as proof of Swift's approaching \"insanity\".In part VIII of his series, The Story of Civilization, Will Durant describes the final years of Swift's life as such:\"Definite symptoms of madness appeared in 1738. In 1741 guardians were appointed to take care of his affairs and watch lest in his outbursts of violence he should do himself harm. In 1742 he suffered great pain from the inflammation of his left eye, which swelled to the size of an egg; five attendants had to restrain him from tearing out his eye. He went a whole year without uttering a word.\"[25]In 1744, Alexander Pope died. Then on 19 October 1745, Swift, at nearly 80, died.[26] After being laid out in public view for the people of Dublin to pay their last respects, he was buried in his own cathedral by Esther Johnson's side, in accordance with his wishes. The bulk of his fortune (£12,000) was left to found a hospital for the mentally ill, originally known as St Patrick’s Hospital for Imbeciles, which opened in 1757, and which still exists as a psychiatric hospital.[26]Jonathan Swift wrote his own epitaph:Hic depositum est Corpus IONATHAN SWIFT S.T.D. Hujus Ecclesiæ Cathedralis Decani, Ubi sæva Indignatio Ulterius Cor lacerare nequit, Abi Viator Et imitare, si poteris, Strenuum pro virili Libertatis Vindicatorem.  Obiit 19º Die Mensis Octobris A.D. 1745 Anno Ætatis 78º.Here is laid the Body of Jonathan Swift, Doctor of Sacred Theology, Dean of this Cathedral Church,  where fierce Indignation can no longer injure the Heart. Go forth, Voyager, and copy, if you can, this vigorous (to the best of his ability) Champion of Liberty.  He died on the 19th Day of the Month of October, A.D. 1745, in the 78th Year of his Age.W. B. Yeats poetically translated it from the Latin as:Swift was a prolific writer, notable for his satires. The most recent collection of his prose works (Herbert Davis, ed. Basil Blackwell, 1965–) comprises fourteen volumes. A recent edition of his complete poetry (Pat Rodges, ed. Penguin, 1983) is 953 pages long. One edition of his correspondence (David Woolley, ed. P. Lang, 1999) fills three volumes.Swift's first major prose work, A Tale of a Tub, demonstrates many of the themes and stylistic techniques he would employ in his later work. It is at once wildly playful and funny while being pointed and harshly critical of its targets. In its main thread, the Tale recounts the exploits of three sons, representing the main threads of Christianity, who receive a bequest from their father of a coat each, with the added instructions to make no alterations whatsoever. However, the sons soon find that their coats have fallen out of current fashion, and begin to look for loopholes in their father's will that will let them make the needed alterations. As each finds his own means of getting around their father's admonition, they struggle with each other for power and dominance. Inserted into this story, in alternating chapters, the narrator includes a series of whimsical \"digressions\" on various subjects.In 1690, Sir William Temple, Swift's patron, published An Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning a defence of classical writing (see Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns), holding up the Epistles of Phalaris as an example. William Wotton responded to Temple with Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning (1694), showing that the Epistles were a later forgery. A response by the supporters of the Ancients was then made by Charles Boyle (later the 4th Earl of Orrery and father of Swift's first biographer). A further retort on the Modern side came from Richard Bentley, one of the pre-eminent scholars of the day, in his essay Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris (1699). The final words on the topic belong to Swift in his Battle of the Books (1697, published 1704) in which he makes a humorous defence on behalf of Temple and the cause of the Ancients.In 1708, a cobbler named John Partridge published a popular almanac of astrological predictions. Because Partridge falsely determined the deaths of several church officials, Swift attacked Partridge in Predictions for the Ensuing Year by Isaac Bickerstaff, a parody predicting that Partridge would die on 29 March. Swift followed up with a pamphlet issued on 30 March claiming that Partridge had in fact died, which was widely believed despite Partridge's statements to the contrary. According to other sources,[citation needed] Richard Steele uses the personae of Isaac Bickerstaff and was the one who wrote about the \"death\" of John Partridge and published it in The Spectator, not Jonathan Swift.Drapier's Letters (1724) was a series of pamphlets against the monopoly granted by the English government to William Wood to provide the Irish with copper coinage. It was widely believed that Wood would need to flood Ireland with debased coinage in order to make a profit. In these \"letters\" Swift posed as a shop-keeper—a draper—to criticise the plan. Swift's writing was so effective in undermining opinion in the project that a reward was offered by the government to anyone disclosing the true identity of the author. Though hardly a secret (on returning to Dublin after one of his trips to England, Swift was greeted with a banner, \"Welcome Home, Drapier\") no one turned Swift in, although there was an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the publisher Harding.[27] The government eventually resorted to hiring none other than Sir Isaac Newton to certify the soundness of Wood's coinage to counter Swift's accusations. In \"Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift\" (1739) Swift recalled this as one of his best achievements.Gulliver's Travels, a large portion of which Swift wrote at Woodbrook House in County Laois, was published in 1726. It is regarded as his masterpiece. As with his other writings, the Travels was published under a pseudonym, the fictional Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon and later a sea captain. Some of the correspondence between printer Benj. Motte and Gulliver's also-fictional cousin negotiating the book's publication has survived. Though it has often been mistakenly thought of and published in bowdlerised form as a children's book, it is a great and sophisticated satire of human nature based on Swift's experience of his times. Gulliver's Travels is an anatomy of human nature, a sardonic looking-glass, often criticised for its apparent misanthropy. It asks its readers to refute it, to deny that it has adequately characterised human nature and society. Each of the four books—recounting four voyages to mostly fictional exotic lands—has a different theme, but all are attempts to deflate human pride. Critics hail the work as a satiric reflection on the shortcomings of Enlightenment thought.In 1729, Swift published A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland Being a Burden on Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick, a satire in which the narrator, with intentionally grotesque arguments, recommends that Ireland's poor escape their poverty by selling their children as food to the rich: \"I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food...\" Following the satirical form, he introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by deriding them:Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients...taxing our absentees...using [nothing] except what is of our own growth and manufacture...rejecting...foreign luxury...introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance...learning to love our country...quitting our animosities and factions...teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants....Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.John Ruskin named him as one of the three people in history who were the most influential for him.[29]George Orwell named him as one of the writers he most admired, despite disagreeing with him on almost every moral and political issue.[30] Modernist poet Edith Sitwell wrote a fictional biography of Switft titled in I Live Under a Black Sun published in 1937.[31]Swift crater, a crater on Mars's moon Deimos, is named after Jonathan Swift, who predicted the existence of the moons of Mars.[32]In honour of Swift's long-time residence in Trim, there are several monuments in the town marking his legacy. Most notable is Swift's Street, named after him. Trim also holds a recurring festival in honour of Swift, called the 'Trim Swift Festival'.Jake Arnott features him in his 2017 novel The Fatal Tree.[33]Online

giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, literally \"black and white cat-foot\"; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo, literally \"big bear cat\"),[3] also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear[4] native to south central China.[1] It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name \"giant panda\" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.[5] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.[6][7]The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.[8] As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.The giant panda is a conservation reliant vulnerable species.[9][10] A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country.[11] As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries.[12] Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild,[11] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.[13] Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise.[14] In March 2015, Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864 individuals.[15] In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\"[10] (it did not believe there was enough certainty yet to do so in 2008[16]).While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda appears at least as commonly. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons.[17] However, molecular studies suggest the giant panda is a true bear and part of the family Ursidae,[4][18] though it differentiated early in history from the main ursine stock. The giant panda's closest extant relative is the spectacled bear of South America.[19] The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.[20]Despite the shared name, habitat type, and diet, as well as a unique enlarged bone called the pseudo thumb (which helps them grip the bamboo shoots they eat) the giant panda and red panda are only distantly related.The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found.[21] The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world originally applied this name to the red panda. Until 1901, when it was erroneously stated to be related to the red panda, the giant panda was known as \"black and white cat-footed animal\" (Ailuropus melanoleucus).[22]In most encyclopedic sources, the name \"panda\" or \"common panda\" originally referred to the lesser-known red panda,[23] thus necessitating the inclusion of \"giant\" and \"lesser/red\" prefixes in front of the names. Even in 2013, the Encyclopædia Britannica still used \"giant panda\" or \"panda bear\" for the bear,[24] and simply \"panda\" for the Ailuridae,[25] despite the popular usage of the word \"panda\".Since the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear 20 different names, such as huāxióng (花熊 \"spotted bear\") and zhúxióng (竹熊 \"bamboo bear\").[26] The most popular names in China today is dàxióngmāo (大熊貓 literally \"giant bear cat\"), or simply xióngmāo (熊貓 \"bear cat\"). The name xióngmāo (熊貓 \"bear cat\") was originally used to describe the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), but since giant panda was thought to be closely related to red panda, dàxióngmāo (大熊貓) was named relatively.[26]In Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted dàmāoxióng (大貓熊 \"giant cat bear\"), though many encyclopediae and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the \"bear cat\" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, \"bear\" instead of \"cat\" is the base noun, making this name more grammatically and logically correct, which may have led to the popular choice despite official writings.[26] This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident.[27][28]Two subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, color patterns, and population genetics (Wan et al., 2005).A detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012[31] confirms that the separation of the Qinlin population occurred about 300,000 years ago, and reveals that the non-Qinlin population further diverged into two groups, named the Minshan and the Qionglai-Daxiangling-Xiaoxiangling-Liangshan group respectively, about 2,800 years ago.[32]The giant panda has luxuriant black-and-white fur. Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 m (4 to 6 ft) long, including a tail of about 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in), and 60 to 90 cm (2.0 to 3.0 ft) tall at the shoulder.[33][34] Males can weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb).[35] Females (generally 10–20% smaller than males)[36] can weigh as little as 70 kg (150 lb), but can also weigh up to 125 kg (276 lb).[9][33][37] Average adult weight is 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb).[38]The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat.[39] The giant panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.[39] The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa.[40][41] A 110.45 kg (243.5 lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292.[citation needed] Another study had a 117.5 kg (259 lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.[42]The giant panda's paw has a \"thumb\" and five fingers; the \"thumb\" – actually a modified sesamoid bone – helps it to hold bamboo while eating.[43] Stephen Jay Gould discusses this feature in his book of essays on evolution and biology, The Panda's Thumb.The giant panda's tail, measuring 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in), is the second-longest in the bear family. (The longest belongs to the sloth bear.)[36]The giant panda typically lives around 20 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity.[44] A female named Jia Jia was the oldest giant panda ever in captivity, born in 1978 and died at an age of 38 on October 16, 2016.[45]A seven-year-old female named Jin Yi died in 2014 in a zoo in Zhengzhou, China, after showing symptoms of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. It was found that the cause of death was toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii and infecting most warm-blooded animals, including humans.[46]The giant panda genome was sequenced in 2009 using Illumina dye sequencing.[47] Its genome contains 20 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes.The giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly Sichuan Province.[48] Giant pandas are generally solitary,[49] and each adult has a defined territory, and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather.[50] After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.[51]Pandas were thought to fall into the crepuscular category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn and dusk; however, Jindong Zhang found that pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with activity peaks in the morning, afternoon and midnight. Due to their sheer size, pandas do not need to fear predators like other herbivores. They can therefore be active at any time of the day.[52]Pandas communicate through vocalization and scent marking such as clawing trees or spraying urine.[9] They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate, which is similar to other subtropical mammals, and will instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures.[53] Pandas rely primarily on spatial memory rather than visual memory.[54]Though the panda is often assumed to be docile, it has been known to attack humans, presumably out of irritation rather than aggression.[55][56][57]Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo.[44] However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes,[58] and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[59][60] Pandas are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation.[61] The giant panda is a \"highly specialized\" animal with \"unique adaptations\", and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years.[49] The average giant panda eats as much as 9 to 14 kg (20 to 30 lb) of bamboo shoots a day to compensate for its low level of energy digestibility. Ingestion of such a large quantity of material is possible because of the rapid passage of large amounts of indigestible plant material through the short, straight digestive tract.[62][63] It is also noted, however, that such rapid passage of digesta limits the potential of microbial digestion in the gastrointestinal tract,[62] limiting alternative forms of digestion. Given this voluminous diet, the giant panda defecates up to 40 times a day.[64] The limited energy input imposed on it by its diet has affected the panda's behavior. The giant panda tends to limit its social interactions and avoids steeply sloping terrain to limit its energy expenditures.[65]Two of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are adaptations to its bamboo diet. Anthropologist Russell Ciochon observed: \"[much] like the vegetarian gorilla, the low body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo.\"[65] Similarly, the giant panda's round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw.[65] Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.The morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya), it only became herbivorous some 2-2.4 mya with the emergence of A. microta.[66][67] Genome sequencing of the giant panda suggests that the dietary switch could have initiated from the loss of the sole T1R1/T1R3 umami taste receptor, resulting from two frameshift mutations within the T1R1 exons.[68] Umami taste corresponds to high levels of glutamate as found in meat, and may have thus altered the food choice of the giant panda.[69] Although the pseudogenization of the umami taste receptor in Ailuropoda coincides with the dietary switch to herbivory, it is likely a result of, and not the reason for, the dietary change.[67][68][69] The mutation time for the T1R1 gene in the giant panda is estimated to 4.2 mya[67] while fossil evidence indicates bamboo consumption in the giant panda species at least 7 mya,[66] signifying that although complete herbivory occurred around 2 mya, the dietary switch was initiated prior to T1R1 loss-of-function.Pandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild, such as Fargesia dracocephala[70] and Fargesia rufa.[71] Only a few bamboo species are widespread at the high altitudes pandas now inhabit. Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less.[72]Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth, and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.[73]Pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. For six years, scientists studied six pandas tagged with GPS collars at the Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. They took note of their foraging and mating habits, and analysed samples of their food and feces. The pandas would move from the valleys in to the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn. During the summer months bamboo shoots rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low calcium rates in the pandas and during breeding season the pandas would trek back down to eat bamboo leaves rich in calcium.[74]Initially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination, as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured.[76] This led some scientists to try extreme methods, such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating[77] and giving the males sildenafil (commonly known as \"Viagra\").[78] Only recently have researchers started having success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the American black bear, a thriving bear species. The normal reproductive rate is considered to be one young every two years.[14][48]Giant pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of four and eight, and may be reproductive until age 20.[79] The mating season is between March and May, when a female goes into estrus, which lasts for two or three days and only occurs once a year.[80] When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts her from behind. Copulation time is short, ranging from 30 seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilization. The gestation period ranges from 95 to 160 days.[80]Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies.[81] If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild. The mother will select the stronger of the cubs, and the weaker will die. The mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two cubs, since she does not store fat.[82] The father has no part in helping raise the cub.When the cub is first born, it is pink, blind, and toothless,[83] weighing only 90 to 130 grams (3.2 to 4.6 ounces), or about 1/800th of the mother's weight,[17] proportionally the smallest baby of any placental mammal.[84] It nurses from its mother's breast six to 14 times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time. For three to four hours, the mother may leave the den to feed, which leaves the cub defenseless. One to two weeks after birth, the cub's skin turns gray where its hair will eventually become black. A slight pink color may appear on cub's fur, as a result of a chemical reaction between the fur and its mother's saliva. A month after birth, the color pattern of the cub's fur is fully developed. Its fur is very soft and coarsens with age. The cub begins to crawl at 75 to 80 days;[17] mothers play with their cubs by rolling and wrestling with them. The cubs can eat small quantities of bamboo after six months,[85] though mother's milk remains the primary food source for most of the first year. Giant panda cubs weigh 45 kg (100 pounds) at one year, and live with their mothers until they are 18 months to two years old. The interval between births in the wild is generally two years.In July 2009, Chinese scientists confirmed the birth of the first cub to be successfully conceived through artificial insemination using frozen sperm.[86] The cub was born at 07:41 on 23 July that year in Sichuan as the third cub of You You, an 11-year-old.[86][87][88] The technique for freezing the sperm in liquid nitrogen was first developed in 1980 and the first birth was hailed as a solution to the problem of lessening giant panda semen availability, which had led to inbreeding.[88][89] Panda semen, which can be frozen for decades, could be shared between different zoos to save the species.[86][87] It is expected that zoos in destinations such as San Diego in the United States and Mexico City will now be able to provide their own semen to inseminate more giant pandas.[89] In August 2014, a rare birth of panda triplets was announced in China; it was the fourth of such births ever reported.[90]Attempts have also been made to reproduce giant pandas by interspecific pregnancy by implanting cloned panda embryos into the uterus of an animal of another species. This has resulted in panda fetuses, but no live births.[91]In the past, pandas were thought to be rare and noble creatures – the Empress Dowager Bo was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of Emperor Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in Ancient China, pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts to control menses as described in the Qin Dynasty encyclopedia Erya.[92]The creature named mo (貘) mentioned in some ancient books has been interpreted as giant panda.[92] The dictionary Shuowen Jiezi (Eastern Han Dynasty) says that the mo, from Shu (Sichuan), is bear-like, but yellow-and-black,[93] although the older Erya describes mo simply as a \"white leopard\".[94] The interpretation of the legendary fierce creature pixiu (貔貅) as referring to the giant panda is also common.[95]During the reign of the Yongle Emperor (early 15th century), his relative from Kaifeng sent him a captured zouyu (騶虞), and another zouyu was sighted in Shandong. Zouyu is a legendary \"righteous\" animal, which, similarly to a qilin, only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere monarch. It is said to be fierce as a tiger, but gentle and strictly vegetarian, and described in some books as a white tiger with black spots. Puzzled about the real zoological identity of the creature captured during the Yongle era, J.J.L. Duyvendak exclaims, \"Can it possibly have been a Pandah?\"[96]The comparative obscurity of the giant panda throughout most of China's history is illustrated by the fact that, despite there being a number of depictions of bears in Chinese art starting from its most ancient times, and the bamboo being one of the favorite subjects for Chinese painters, there are no known pre-20th-century artistic representations of giant pandas.The West first learned of the giant panda on 11 March 1869, when the French missionary Armand David[17] received a skin from a hunter. The first Westerner known to have seen a living giant panda is the German zoologist Hugo Weigold, who purchased a cub in 1916. Kermit and Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., became the first Westerners to shoot a panda, on an expedition funded by the Field Museum of Natural History in the 1920s. In 1936, Ruth Harkness became the first Westerner to bring back a live giant panda, a cub named Su Lin[97] which went to live at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. In 1938, five giant pandas were sent to London.[98][99] Activities such as these were halted because of wars; in subsequent decades, the West knew little of giant pandas.Gifts of giant pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part of the diplomacy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the 1970s, as it marked some of the first cultural exchanges between the PRC and the West. This practice has been termed \"panda diplomacy\".By 1984, however, pandas were no longer given as gifts. Instead, the PRC began to offer pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans, under terms including a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of the PRC. Since 1998, because of a WWF lawsuit, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service allows a US zoo to import a panda only if the zoo can ensure the PRC will channel more than half of its loan fee into conservation efforts for the giant panda and its habitat.In May 2005, the PRC offered a breeding pair to Taiwan. The issue became embroiled in cross-Strait relations – both over the underlying symbolism, and over technical issues such as whether the transfer would be considered \"domestic\" or \"international\", or whether any true conservation purpose would be served by the exchange.[100] A contest in 2006 to name the pandas was held in the mainland, resulting in the politically charged names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan (from tuanyuan, meaning \"reunion\", i.e. \"reunification\"). PRC's offer was initially rejected by Chen Shui-bian, then President of Taiwan. However, when Ma Ying-jeou assumed the presidency in 2008, the offer was accepted, and the pandas arrived in December of that year.[101]Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating biofuels from bamboo and other plant materials.[102]The giant panda is a vulnerable species, threatened by continued habitat loss and habitat fragmentation,[103] and by a very low birthrate, both in the wild and in captivity.[44] Its range is currently confined to a small portion on the western edge of its historical range, which stretched through southern and eastern China, northern Myanmar, and northern Vietnam.[1]The giant panda has been a target of poaching by locals since ancient times and by foreigners since it was introduced to the West. Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat, and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. During the Cultural Revolution, all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were stopped. After the Chinese economic reform, demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the black market, acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.Though the Wolong National Nature Reserve was set up by the PRC government in 1958 to save the declining panda population, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made, owing to inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas was to cage them. As a result, pandas were caged at any sign of decline, and suffered from terrible conditions. Because of pollution and destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a rare species.In 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes DNA from panda droppings, scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000.[44] In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves two decades ago.[13] As the species has been reclassified to \"vulnerable\" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the State Forestry Administration of China announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.[104]The giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a UNESCO World Heritage Site designation. The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, located in the southwest Sichuan province and covering seven natural reserves, were inscribed onto the World Heritage List in 2006.[105][106]Not all conservationists agree that the money spent on conserving pandas is well spent. Chris Packham has argued that the breeding of pandas in captivity is \"pointless\" because \"there is not enough habitat left to sustain them\".[107] Packham argues that the money spent on pandas would be better spent elsewhere,[107] and has said he would \"eat the last panda if I could have all the money we have spent on panda conservation put back on the table for me to do more sensible things with\",[108] though he has apologized for upsetting people who like pandas.[109] He points out, \"The panda is possibly one of the grossest wastes of conservation money in the last half century.\"[108] However, a 2015 paper found that the giant panda can serve as an umbrella species as the preservation of their habitat also helps other endemic species in China, including 70% of the country's forest birds, 70% of mammals and 31% of amphibians.[110]In 2012, Earthwatch Institute, a global nonprofit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct important environmental research, launched a program called \"On the Trail of Giant Panda\". This program, based in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, allows volunteers to work up close with pandas cared for in captivity, and help them adapt to life in the wild, so that they may breed, and live longer and healthier lives.[111]Pandas have been kept in zoos as early as the Western Han Dynasty in China, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of exotic animals in the capital Chang'an (present Xi'an). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos.[112]Chi Chi at the London Zoo became very popular. This influenced the World Wildlife Fund to use a panda as its symbol.[113]A 2006 New York Times article[114] outlined the economics of keeping pandas, which costs five times more than that of the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1 million a year in fees, as part of a typical ten-year contract. San Diego's contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost.[115] The last contract, with the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, Tennessee, ended in 2013.[114]AsiaMany zoos and breeding centers in China house giant pandas.

The North-East Pacific is home to the Juan de Fuca plate—smallest of Earth’s 12 tectonic plates. Its small size and close proximity to the coast gives NEPTUNE Canada a unique opportunity to observe tectonic processes. NEPTUNE Canada is built to provide continuous observations for 25 years. The time-series data gathered will allow scientists to study long-term changes over the life of the project. Instruments comprising the undersea observatory will operate at depths ranging from 17 to 2,660 m. Hundreds of instruments have been connected to the Internet by way of shielded cables carrying both power and fibre-optic communication lines. A database will archive and provide networked access to all archived data. Taking advantage of this platform, scientists collaborating with NEPTUNE are expected to conduct thousands of unique experiments over the life of the project.\nThe NEPTUNE Ocean Observatory project is part of Ocean Networks Canada which is a University of Victoria initiative.

FISHER","text":"GALWAY FISHER:Galway (/ˈɡɔːlweɪ/; Irish: Gaillimh, pronounced [ˈɡalʲɪvʲ]) is a city in the West of Ireland in the province of Connacht. Galway City Council is the local authority for the city. Galway lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay and is surrounded by County Galway. It is the fourth most populous urban area in the Republic of Ireland and the sixth most populous city in the island of Ireland. According to the 2016 Irish Census, Galway city has a population of 79,504; however, the rural county agglomeration is far bigger.Galway will be European Capital of Culture in 2020, alongside Rijeka, Croatia.The city's name is from the Irish name for Abhainn na Gaillimhe (\"Galway\"), which formed the western boundary of the earliest settlement, Dún Bhun na Gaillimhe \"Fort at the mouth of the Gaillimh\".[4] (Mythical and alternative derivations of the name are given in History of Galway).Historically, the name was Anglicised as Galliv,[5] which is closer to the Irish pronunciation as is the city's name in Latin, Galvia.\nThe city also bears the nickname \"The City of the Tribes\" (Irish: Cathair na dTreabh) because of the fourteen merchant families called the \"tribes of Galway\"[6] led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period. The term tribes was a derogatory one, because the merchants saw themselves as Anglo-Irish and were loyal to the King during the English Civil War.[citation needed] They later adopted the term as a badge of honour and pride in defiance of the town's Cromwellian occupier. Residents of the city refer to themselves as \"Galwegians\".Dún Bhun na Gaillimhe (\"Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh\") was constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088–1156). Eventually, a small settlement grew up around this fort. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, Galway fort was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city.[citation needed]\nHistorical population. This led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas Óge Martyn, stated \"From the Ferocious O'Flahertys may God protect us\". A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway's Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying \"neither O’ nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway\" without permission. During the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the \"The Tribes of Galway\". The city thrived on international trade, and in the Middle Ages, it was the principal Irish port for trade with Spain and France. The most famous reminder of those days is ceann an bhalla (\"the end of the wall\"), now known as the Spanish Arch, constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin (1519–20). In 1477 Christopher Columbus visited Galway, possibly stopping off on a voyage to Iceland or the Faroe Islands. Seven or eight years later, he noted in the margin of his copy of Imago Mundi:Men of Cathay have come from the west. [Of this] we have seen many signs. And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman, of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks [or timbers? or a boat made of such?]The most likely explanation for these bodies is that they were Inuit swept eastward by the North Atlantic Current.[4]During the 16th and 17th centuries Galway remained loyal to the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At the end of the 17th century the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city suffered further under the potato famines of 1845–1852, and it did not fully recover until the period of strong economic growth of the late 20th century (see Celtic Tiger).","path":[46688,-6.207,53.3455,46417,-6.2075,53.34483,46137,-6.205333,53.34383,45977,-6.201167,53.34333,45867,-6.1975,53.34333,45726,-6.192,53.34317,45587,-6.186333,53.343,45437,-6.18,53.34317,45308,-6.174333,53.343,45168,-6.167167,53.34333,45017,-6.157166,53.3435,44877,-6.1455,53.34317,44728,-6.133333,53.34233,44597,-6.122334,53.3415,44468,-6.111333,53.34083,44317,-6.099,53.33883,44177,-6.088,53.3365,44048,-6.077833,53.334,43928,-6.068833,53.33133,43778,-6.059333,53.32567,43606,-6.049667,53.31833,43458,-6.041333,53.31183,43317,-6.0335,53.30567,43117,-6.0235,53.29817,42937,-6.016833,53.29267,42788,-6.009666,53.28633,42667,-6.003833,53.281,42488,-5.995833,53.27234,42367,-5.991167,53.26633,42168,-5.9855,53.25583,42027,-5.983,53.24817,41878,-5.9805,53.24,41727,-5.977833,53.23167,41556,-5.975,53.2225,41407,-5.972333,53.21433,41277,-5.969833,53.20716,41088,-5.9665,53.197,40937,-5.963666,53.18867,40796,-5.961167,53.181,40647,-5.9585,53.17283,40507,-5.956167,53.165,40378,-5.953833,53.15783,40226,-5.951,53.1495,40076,-5.948167,53.141,39896,-5.944667,53.131,39748,-5.941833,53.12267,39618,-5.9395,53.11567,39498,-5.9375,53.10917,39357,-5.935333,53.10167,39207,-5.933167,53.0935,39067,-5.931,53.08583,38926,-5.929,53.07883,38776,-5.927333,53.07267,38558,-5.925,53.06433,38397,-5.923,53.05767,38248,-5.9205,53.04967,38128,-5.918667,53.04317,37986,-5.9165,53.03567,37838,-5.914333,53.02767,37687,-5.912,53.01983,37537,-5.9095,53.01167,37387,-5.907333,53.00383,37177,-5.904,52.99283,37037,-5.901667,52.9855,36818,-5.8985,52.97433,36677,-5.8965,52.967,36538,-5.894166,52.95984,36387,-5.891833,52.95217,36257,-5.889833,52.94567,36036,-5.8865,52.93467,35887,-5.884167,52.92733,35747,-5.882,52.92033,35597,-5.879667,52.913,35377,-5.876333,52.90217,35230,-5.873667,52.895,35086,-5.874333,52.88766,34946,-5.875333,52.88066,34788,-5.876667,52.87267,34628,-5.877833,52.86467,34417,-5.8795,52.85417,34268,-5.8805,52.84683,34127,-5.8815,52.83983,33977,-5.882667,52.83233,33758,-5.884,52.8215,33617,-5.885,52.81467,33458,-5.886,52.80684,33316,-5.886833,52.8,33187,-5.887667,52.79367,33046,-5.8885,52.78683,32876,-5.8895,52.77867,32698,-5.890666,52.76983,32537,-5.891667,52.76217,32398,-5.8925,52.75533,32248,-5.893167,52.74817,32108,-5.893833,52.7415,31957,-5.894333,52.73433,31797,-5.894667,52.72683,31638,-5.895167,52.71933,31467,-5.895667,52.71117,31337,-5.895833,52.70483,31188,-5.896333,52.69767,31017,-5.896833,52.6895,30816,-5.8975,52.68,30666,-5.898167,52.67283,30568,-5.8985,52.66817,30426,-5.899,52.6615,30276,-5.8995,52.65467,30137,-5.899833,52.64817,29977,-5.9,52.641,29818,-5.900333,52.63383,29657,-5.9005,52.62667,29497,-5.900833,52.6195,29357,-5.901166,52.61317,29196,-5.9015,52.606,29047,-5.901834,52.59933,28887,-5.9025,52.59217,28748,-5.903,52.58583,28587,-5.903833,52.57867,28367,-5.905667,52.56867,28227,-5.906667,52.5625,28077,-5.907833,52.55567,27918,-5.909,52.5485,27758,-5.910167,52.54117,27598,-5.911167,52.53433,27436,-5.912,52.52717,27227,-5.912333,52.51817,27056,-5.9125,52.51083,26907,-5.912667,52.50417,26778,-5.913,52.49866,26577,-5.9135,52.48983,26417,-5.914333,52.483,26247,-5.915167,52.4755,26107,-5.916,52.46933,25956,-5.916833,52.46267,25816,-5.917666,52.45667,25676,-5.918334,52.4505,25517,-5.919167,52.44333,25377,-5.919833,52.43733,25217,-5.920833,52.43017,25077,-5.921667,52.424,24917,-5.9225,52.41683,24758,-5.923333,52.40967,24617,-5.924,52.4035,24476,-5.924833,52.39717,24318,-5.925667,52.39034,24177,-5.9265,52.384,23976,-5.927834,52.37517,23828,-5.928667,52.36867,23627,-5.929833,52.36,23467,-5.930666,52.353,23258,-5.9315,52.34383,23117,-5.932167,52.3375,22966,-5.933,52.33083,22817,-5.933667,52.32417,22657,-5.934667,52.317,22507,-5.9355,52.31017,22367,-5.935833,52.30383,22227,-5.936333,52.2975,22078,-5.936833,52.29067,21876,-5.9375,52.2815,21718,-5.938167,52.27433,21567,-5.938833,52.2675,21427,-5.939333,52.261,21278,-5.939833,52.25433,21127,-5.940333,52.24733,20917,-5.941333,52.2375,20767,-5.942167,52.2305,20557,-5.942833,52.22066,20417,-5.943666,52.21433,20297,-5.946833,52.20917,20177,-5.95,52.204,20057,-5.953166,52.19883,19898,-5.9575,52.192,19748,-5.961333,52.18567,19587,-5.965667,52.1785,19436,-5.9695,52.17216,19236,-5.974833,52.16333,19097,-5.9785,52.15733,18878,-5.984334,52.14767,18738,-5.988,52.14167,18598,-5.9915,52.13533,18421,-5.995167,52.12733,18216,-6.006166,52.12033,18067,-6.015,52.11533,17916,-6.023833,52.11033,17787,-6.031333,52.106,17647,-6.0395,52.10117,17497,-6.048333,52.09617,17357,-6.056667,52.09184,17137,-6.07,52.08484,16996,-6.078833,52.08033,16827,-6.089334,52.075,16697,-6.0975,52.07067,16548,-6.106833,52.06583,16388,-6.117,52.06067,16248,-6.125834,52.056,16107,-6.1345,52.0515,15948,-6.144166,52.046,15787,-6.1565,52.04284,15628,-6.169,52.04,15487,-6.18,52.0375,15278,-6.1965,52.03367,15137,-6.2075,52.031,14988,-6.219167,52.02833,14848,-6.230166,52.02567,14707,-6.241333,52.02317,14706,-6.241333,52.02317,14557,-6.253,52.02033,14406,-6.264833,52.01767,14267,-6.275667,52.01534,14127,-6.286833,52.013,13907,-6.3

ENDEAVOUR","text":"EUROPEAN ENDEAVOUR:The MS European Endeavour is a roll-on/roll-off passenger ferry which is owned and operated by P&O Ferries. P&O took delivery of the ship in October 2007 from Acciona Trasmediterránea. She is the 28th member of the current P&O fleet and is the second P&O ship to have carried the name European Endeavour; the first was subsequently operated as the MV Gardenia of Transeuropa Ferries, and was later scrapped in December 2016 under the name MV Star Fighter.The ship was built in 2000 for Merchant Ferries as Midnight Merchant for a planned service between Liverpool and Belfast, however the ship was chartered to Norfolkline for their new service between Dover and Dunkirk and remained on that route until July 2006 when she was replaced by one of three new ships for the service.In August 2006 she was chartered to Acciona Trasmediterránea for service in the Mediterranean and renamed El Greco registered under the Spanish flag.On 26 June 2007 it was announced that P&O Ferries had agreed to purchase the ship in order to meet the growing demand for space from haulage customers throughout its operations. The ship will primarily be used on the Dover–Calais route but also on P&O Ferries Irish Sea and North Sea routes to cover for the refit of other vessels.[3] The ship entered service with P&O on their Liverpool-Dublin route on 6 November 2007.The ship has been involved in two incidents. On 22 March 2008 the ships mooring ropes parted resulting is her drifting across the eastern entrance of Dover Harbour. The ship was assisted back to her berth by a Dover Harbour tug.[4] On 29 August 2008 the ship suffered a partial lost of electrical power which resulted in a collision with Linkspan 7 in Calais. European Endeavour's 'cow catcher', a metal structure welded to the bow to support the bow ramp when deployed, was demolished and significant damage was caused to the linkspan.[5]Due to a downturn in freight traffic P&O Ferries laid up the ship in Tilbury in May 2010. She was chartered to DFDS Seaways in August 2010 and early September 2010 to provide refit cover on the Birkenhead–Dublin and Belfast routes. On completion of this charter the ship was sent for its annual overhaul and then proceeded to Dunkerque for layup. She remained in Dunkerque until early February 2011 when she sailed for Liverpool in preparation for returning to service on the Liverpool-Dublin service replacing the M/V Norcape.It was P&O's intention that the ship would primarily be used between Dover and Calais but would also cover the refits of other ships on the following routes:-It was discovered that the ship was too wide to fit through the lock at Hull so she did not serve the routes from that port as intended. She was briefly used on a re-established Dover-Zeebrugge route but the service only lasted for one day due to lack of freight.The ship was one of four ordered for Merchant Ferries services on the Irish Sea. Collectively they are known as the Racehorses because of their naming.

ROGUE","text":"ARKLOW ROGUE:The Red Arrows, officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, is the aerobatics display team of the Royal Air Force based at RAF Scampton. The team was formed in late 1964 as an all-RAF team, replacing a number of unofficial teams that had been sponsored by RAF commands.The Red Arrows have a prominent place in British popular culture, with their aerobatic displays a fixture of British summer events.[1] The badge of the Red Arrows shows the aircraft in their trademark diamond nine formation, with the motto Éclat, a French word meaning \"brilliance\" or \"excellence\".Initially, they were equipped with seven Folland Gnat trainers inherited from the RAF Yellowjacks display team. This aircraft was chosen because it was less expensive to operate than front-line fighters. In their first season, they flew at 65 shows across Europe.

FRIGG","text":"STEN FRIGG:In Germanic mythology, Frigg (Old Norse), Frija (Old High German), Frea (Langobardic), and Frige (Old English) is a goddess. In nearly all sources, she is described as the wife of the god Odin. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is also connected with the goddess Fulla. The English weekday name Friday (etymologically Old English \"Frīge's day\") bears her name. Frigg is described as a goddess associated with foreknowledge and wisdom in Norse mythology, the northernmost branch of Germanic mythology and most extensively attested. Frigg is the wife of the major god Odin and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir, is famous for her foreknowledge, is associated with the goddesses Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, and Gná, and is ambiguously associated with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse \"Earth\"). The children of Frigg and Odin include the gleaming god Baldr. Due to significant thematic overlap, scholars have proposed a particular connection to the goddess Freyja.After Christianization, mention of Frigg continued to occur in Scandinavian folklore. In modern times, Frigg has appeared in modern popular culture, has been the subject of art, and receives modern veneration in Germanic Neopaganism.Etymology, Friday, and toponymy[edit]\nThe theonyms Frigg (Old Norse) and Frija (Old High German) are cognate forms—linguistic siblings of the same origin—that descend from a substantivized feminine of Proto-Germanic *frijaz (via Holtzmann's law). *frijaz descends from the same source (Proto-Indo-European) as the feminine Sanskrit noun priyā and the feminine Avestan noun fryā (both meaning \"own, dear, beloved\").In the modern period, an -a suffix is sometimes applied to denote femininity, resulting in the form Frigga.[2] This spelling also serves the purpose of distancing the goddess from the English word frig.The connection with and possible earlier identification of the goddess Freyja with Frigg in the Proto-Germanic period (Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis) is a matter of scholarly debate.The name Freyja is not attested outside of Scandinavia, like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir. This is in contrast to the name of the goddess Frigg, who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *Frijjō. Evidence does not exist for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Old Norse Freyja descends, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of surviving sources.Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"The English weekday name Friday comes from Old English \"Frīge's Day\" and is cognate with Old High German frîatac. Both weekday names are result of interpretatio germanica that occurred at or before the 3rd or 4th century CE, glossing the Latin weekday name dies Veneris 'Day of Venus'.Several place names refer to Frigg in what are now Norway and Sweden, although her name is altogether absent in recorded place names in Denmark.","path":[71716,-6.206385,53.34554,69736,-6.206378,53.34553,67936,-6.206413,53.34555,65775,-6.206373,53.34554,63975,-6.206412,53.34554,61995,-6.206403,53.34553,60015,-6.20639,53.34551,57855,-6.20641,53.34558,56235,-6.206392,53.34559,54076,-6.206365,53.34552,52275,-6.206427,53.34552,50475,-6.206432,53.3455,48495,-6.206415,53.3455,46515,-6.206367,53.34555,44535,-6.20641,53.34556,42555,-6.206392,53.34556,40755,-6.206365,53.34556,38595,-6.206353,53.34555,36615,-6.206398,53.34555,34635,-6.206423,53.34554,32835,-6.206383,53.34556,30855,-6.206373,53.34554,29056,-6.2064,53.34556,27569,-6.206422,53.34553,26229,-6.20628,53.34555,26100,-6.206315,53.34543,25980,-6.206217,53.34509,25850,-6.205827,53.34464,25678,-6.20536,53.34391,25520,-6.204682,53.34356,25230,-6.20051,53.34348,25050,-6.196035,53.34343,24889,-6.190393,53.34346,24718,-6.182193,53.34366,24510,-6.16837,53.34372,24360,-6.156617,53.34375,24240,-6.146719,53.34318,24118,-6.136402,53.34243,23959,-6.122608,53.34185,23808,-6.109374,53.34052,23669,-6.098047,53.33782,23540,-6.087503,53.33559,23399,-6.075593,53.33535,23249,-6.062743,53.33829,23110,-6.05195,53.34199,22980,-6.043345,53.34503,22839,-6.034685,53.34804,22650,-6.020215,53.3526,22508,-6.007107,53.35626,22369,-5.99426,53.35977,22229,-5.981184,53.36331,22088,-5.967977,53.36681,21959,-5.955525,53.36889,21750,-5.934935,53.37194,21620,-5.92242,53.37387,21500,-5.910712,53.37554,21359,-5.897,53.37641,21150,-5.877337,53.37381,21019,-5.866724,53.37022,20890,-5.857178,53.36538,20670,-5.841213,53.35733,20520,-5.830389,53.35188,20369,-5.81948,53.34651,20249,-5.810781,53.34217,20090,-5.79939,53.33647,19939,-5.78876,53.33118,19788,-5.778093,53.32588,19649,-5.768173,53.32087,19500,-5.757608,53.31545,19300,-5.743622,53.30801,19120,-5.731013,53.30111,18978,-5.7208,53.29584,18849,-5.711226,53.29101,18708,-5.700861,53.28574,18568,-5.690792,53.28067,18420,-5.679837,53.27524,18279,-5.66978,53.27012,18129,-5.658896,53.26479,17990,-5.648489,53.25987,17848,-5.63809,53.25495,17710,-5.627996,53.24977,17570,-5.61832,53.24435,17428,-5.608398,53.23892,17280,-5.598135,53.23329,17160,-5.589688,53.22883,17030,-5.58058,53.22396,16880,-5.570044,53.21825,16749,-5.560755,53.21338,16530,-5.545092,53.20496,16389,-5.535215,53.19961,16248,-5.525456,53.19416,16099,-5.514998,53.18835,15879,-5.499237,53.18003,15719,-5.487835,53.17392,15560,-5.476472,53.16779,15440,-5.467933,53.16317,15320,-5.459173,53.15863,15168,-5.448105,53.15283,15029,-5.43805,53.14756,14889,-5.427518,53.14237,14740,-5.415912,53.13706,14600,-5.405147,53.13206,14460,-5.394627,53.12694,14319,-5.384115,53.12182,14189,-5.374395,53.117,14069,-5.365422,53.11246,13930,-5.354858,53.10721,13778,-5.343343,53.10153,13630,-5.332168,53.09591,13430,-5.317135,53.08836,13230,-5.302197,53.0807,13090,-5.291507,53.07549,12878,-5.276017,53.06675,12719,-5.265117,53.05953,12512,-5.251593,53.05033,12389,-5.25011,53.04308,12230,-5.254218,53.03318,12089,-5.257777,53.02449,11949,-5.26133,53.0158,11799,-5.26517,53.0065,11649,-5.26912,52.99729,11439,-5.274627,52.98441,11289,-5.278525,52.97527,11150,-5.282427,52.96675,11009,-5.28635,52.95828,10869,-5.290232,52.94965,10726,-5.29412,52.9408,10587,-5.297892,52.93218,10444,-5.301688,52.92317,10303,-5.305343,52.91444,10163,-5.309015,52.90575,10014,-5.312858,52.89654,9813,-5.318357,52.88425,9673,-5.322335,52.87566,9513,-5.326823,52.86588,9373,-5.330817,52.85727,9222,-5.335173,52.84792,9081,-5.339195,52.83926,8938,-5.343325,52.83028,8739,-5.348862,52.81791,8601,-5.352823,52.80927,8458,-5.356952,52.80023,8260,-5.362478,52.78777,8128,-5.366192,52.77945,7995,-5.369848,52.77104,7851,-5.373767,52.76183,7654,-5.379065,52.74915,7515,-5.382582,52.74026,7383,-5.385839,52.73178,7173,-5.391032,52.71831,7035,-5.394474,52.70948,6897,-5.397982,52.70067,6699,-5.403062,52.68803,6561,-5.4065,52.67923,6423,-5.410073,52.6704,6285,-5.413623,52.66155,6142,-5.417307,52.65231,6009,-5.420795,52.64386,5883,-5.424085,52.63579,5739,-5.427802,52.62651,5601,-5.431462,52.61766,5457,-5.435313,52.60839,5302,-5.439515,52.59836,5164,-5.443198,52.58948,5025,-5.446872,52.58064,4887,-5.45056,52.5718,4756,-5.45412,52.56335,4623,-5.457738,52.55491,4492,-5.461447,52.54653,4335,-5.466408,52.53665,4125,-5.473137,52.52334,3981,-5.477735,52.51422,3699,-5.486279,52.49626,3501,-5.491605,52.48355,3309,-5.496688,52.47122,3142,-5.501182,52.46043,2919,-5.507228,52.44619,2781,-5.510948,52.43734,2637,-5.514712,52.42809,2434,-5.519905,52.41499,2296,-5.52346,52.40615,2152,-5.527242,52.39693,1996,-5.531325,52.38697,1863,-5.534771,52.37853,1653,-5.540455,52.36514,1521,-5.544113,52.35672,1383,-5.547925,52.34792,1179,-5.55359,52.33484,1047,-5.557238,52.3264,910,-5.561023,52.31752,765,-5.565156,52.30827,609,-5.56969,52.29825,412,-5.57546,52.2856]},{"name":"SEATRUCK

PRESS ETNA","text":"X PRESS ETNA:Mount Etna (or Etna; pronunciation: /ˈɛtnə/; Italian: Etna [ˈɛtna] or Mongibello [mondʒiˈbɛllo], Sicilian: Mungibeddu [mʊndʒɪbˈbɛɖɖʊ] or â Muntagna, Latin: Aetna) is an active stratovolcano on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, in the Metropolitan City of Catania, between the cities of Messina and Catania. It lies above the convergent plate margin between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is the tallest active volcano in Europe,currently 3,329 m (10,922 ft) high, though this varies with summit eruptions. It is the highest peak in Italy south of the Alps. Etna covers an area of 1,190 km2 (459 sq mi) with a basal circumference of 140 km. This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius. Only Mount Teide in Tenerife (owned by Spain) surpasses it in the whole of the European–North-African region. In Greek Mythology, the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under this mountain by Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder and king of gods, and the forges of Hephaestus were said to also be located underneath it.Mount Etna is one of the most active volcanoes in the world and is in an almost constant state of activity. The fertile volcanic soils support extensive agriculture, with vineyards and orchards spread across the lower slopes of the mountain and the broad Plain of Catania to the south. Due to its history of recent activity and nearby population, Mount Etna has been designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations In June 2013, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Etymology: According to Adrian Room’s book Place-names of the World, the name Etna originated from the Phoenician word attuna meaning \"furnace\" or \"chimney\". He dismisses the hypothesis that Etna is from the Greek αἴθω (aithō), meaning \"I burn\", through an iotacist pronunciation.[8] In Classical Greek, it is called Αἴτνη (Aítnē),a name given also to Catania and the city originally known as Inessa, and in Latin it is called Aetna. In Arabic, it was called جبل النار Jabal al-Nār (the Mountain of Fire). It is also known as Mungibeddu in Sicilian and Mongibello or Montebello in Italian (The Italian word literally meaning Monte mountain and Bello meaning beautiful, but the Sicilian word is actually thought to be from the Latin mons and the Arabic جبل jabal, both meaning mountain, producing a tautological place name, \"mountain mountain\").[11] The term is not in common use today, although some older people still call it this. According to another hypothesis the term Mongibello comes from the Latin Mulciber (qui ignem mulcet, who placates the fire), one of the Latin names of the Roman god Vulcan. The people of the Etna sometimes use the jargon term 'a muntagna, simply \"the mountain\" par excellence.\nNowadays, the term Mongibello indicates the mountain's top area of the two central craters encompassing also the craters in the southeast and the northeast of the volcanic cone.","path":[82074,-6.210832,53.34362,80632,-6.210834,53.34367,79372,-6.210837,53.34361,78113,-6.210834,53.34367,76853,-6.210834,53.34367,75593,-6.21086,53.34361,74333,-6.21084,53.34361,72353,-6.210852,53.34362,70552,-6.210844,53.34361,69113,-6.210852,53.34361,67852,-6.210848,53.34363,66592,-6.210827,53.34362,64972,-6.210845,53.34362,63712,-6.21085,53.34362,62273,-6.210852,53.34363,60832,-6.210834,53.34367,59573,-6.210834,53.34367,58314,-6.210847,53.34363,56873,-6.210834,53.34367,55613,-6.210834,53.34367,54352,-6.210834,53.34367,53094,-6.210855,53.34366,52913,-6.210667,53.344,52553,-6.209167,53.3465,51832,-6.210263,53.34693,50572,-6.210333,53.347,49312,-6.210233,53.34695,47872,-6.210333,53.34683,46613,-6.210166,53.347,44994,-6.210252,53.34692,43733,-6.210248,53.34692,42473,-6.210255,53.34693,41213,-6.210333,53.347,39054,-6.210257,53.34693,37252,-6.210255,53.34693,35993,-6.210166,53.347,34734,-6.210255,53.34693,33472,-6.21026,53.34693,32212,-6.210333,53.34683,30953,-6.210262,53.34691,29513,-6.21027,53.34692,28252,-6.210333,53.347,26992,-6.210333,53.347,25733,-6.210333,53.347,24474,-6.210253,53.34695,23213,-6.210333,53.347,21953,-6.210247,53.34693,20693,-6.21024,53.34692,19433,-6.210265,53.34692,17994,-6.210262,53.34692,16732,-6.21026,53.34692,15473,-6.210333,53.347,14213,-6.210333,53.347,12952,-6.210333,53.347,11694,-6.21026,53.34694,10254,-6.210227,53.34691,10093,-6.210333,53.34667,9982,-6.210166,53.3465,9858,-6.21023,53.34601,9725,-6.21,53.34566,9612,-6.209495,53.34539,9492,-6.208776,53.34483,9301,-6.2045,53.34383,9181,-6.199333,53.34367,9042,-6.192333,53.34367,8902,-6.184077,53.34381,8782,-6.176579,53.34404,8652,-6.167705,53.34406,8516,-6.15699,53.34393,8318,-6.137671,53.34276,8186,-6.12277,53.34221,8060,-6.108501,53.34064,7926,-6.094203,53.33705,7801,-6.080628,53.33614,7680,-6.068045,53.33786,7540,-6.05467,53.34227,7389,-6.041538,53.34658,7240,-6.03089,53.35,7089,-6.023,53.3525,6957,-6.013834,53.35467,6783,-5.997167,53.35333,6651,-5.9855,53.34983,6499,-5.972648,53.34585,6360,-5.960853,53.34223,6219,-5.949,53.33867,6070,-5.936333,53.33484,5950,-5.925918,53.33171,5821,-5.915,53.3285,5680,-5.90312,53.32469,5530,-5.8905,53.32067,5380,-5.878082,53.31606,5229,-5.8655,53.3115,5080,-5.8532,53.30701,4890,-5.837477,53.30132,4760,-5.826667,53.29733,4600,-5.813167,53.2925,4460,-5.80155,53.28786,4320,-5.790167,53.28316,4200,-5.781,53.27867,3990,-5.764743,53.27077,3840,-5.753112,53.26519,3720,-5.743695,53.26077,3600,-5.734328,53.25624,3410,-5.7195,53.24917,3269,-5.7085,53.24383,3140,-5.698431,53.23905,3006,-5.688334,53.23417,2883,-5.683,53.2275,2753,-5.6844,53.2198,2600,-5.693167,53.2125,2470,-5.701334,53.2065,2330,-5.71005,53.20021,2150,-5.721075,53.19191,1951,-5.7335,53.183,1820,-5.741667,53.17735,1686,-5.7465,53.1705,1560,-5.744493,53.16331,1420,-5.736,53.15667,1280,-5.727,53.15017,1160,-5.7195,53.1445,1040,-5.711833,53.13883,910,-5.703748,53.13271,790,-5.696301,53.12706,669,-5.689015,53.12135,549,-5.681803,53.11564,429,-5.674773,53.10991,300,-5.667117,53.10369,180,-5.660137,53.09778,50,-5.652833,53.09117]},{"name":"RNLI LIFEBOAT B-853","text":"RNLI LIFEBOAT The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is the largest charity that saves lives at sea around the coasts of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as well as on some inland waterways. There are numerous other lifeboat services operating in the same area.Founded in 1824 as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, the RNLI was granted Royal Charter in 1860 and is a charity in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Queen Elizabeth II is Patron. The RNLI is principally funded by legacies and donations with most lifeboat crew members being unpaid volunteers.The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and operates 444 lifeboats. Crews rescued on average 22 people a day in 2015. RNLI Lifeguards operate on more than 200 beaches. They are paid by local authorities, while the RNLI provides equipment and training. The Institution operates Flood Rescue Teams (FRT) nationally and internationally (iFRT), the latter prepared to travel to emergencies overseas at short notice.Considerable effort is put into training and education by the Institution, particularly for young people; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. The Institution has saved some 140,000 lives since its foundation, at a cost of more than 600 lives lost in service.\nSir William Hillary came to live on the Isle of Man in 1808. Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast, he drew up plans for a national lifeboat service manned by trained crews. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty. However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, with the help of Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert, the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824. At the age of 60, Sir William took part in the 1830 rescue of the packet St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. He commanded the lifeboat and was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. It was this incident which prompted Sir William to set up a scheme to build The Tower of Refuge on Conister Rock – a project completed in 1832 which stands to this day at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. In 1854 the institution's name changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (in 1849 Prince Albert had added his support to the Institution[1]) and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of the work of Sir William.1974 postage stamp marking the RNLI's 150th anniversary (rescue of Daunt Lightship's crew by Ballycotton lifeboat RNLB Mary Stanford. Artist: B. F. Gribble)\nIn its first year the RNLI raised £10,000, however by 1849, income had dropped to £354.[3] Finding itself in financial difficulties, the RNLI accepted a government subsidy of £2,000, which rose in subsequent years. This lasted until 1869, when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies; in addition, the government's imposition of bureaucracy and regulations were detrimental to the service.[4] It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new impetus to fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £10,000. The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year.","path":[70826,-9.04695,53.26918,70466,-9.047123,53.26916,69208,-9.046893,53.26912,69025,-9.046832,53.26913,68816,-9.046126,53.26867,68606,-9.0395,53.26241,68457,-9.042171,53.2518,68307,-9.067355,53.24687,68185,-9.077545,53.2545,68067,-9.079953,53.25584,67919,-9.081815,53.25459,67768,-9.073849,53.25108,67590,-9.060512,53.24821,67467,-9.044037,53.24973,67258,-9.037403,53.25106,67051,-9.037579,53.25057,66867,-9.041717,53.24905,66717,-9.042155,53.24904,66508,-9.03724,53.2496,66358,-9.038502,53.25053,66118,-9.039422,53.25097,65967,-9.035024,53.25266,65848,-9.034495,53.25293,65639,-9.034387,53.25413,65462,-9.033495,53.25526,65219,-9.035757,53.25866,65069,-9.046806,53.26902,64776,-9.047245,53.26892]},{"name":"AVALON","text":"AVALON:Avalon (/ˈævəˌlɒn/; Latin: Insula Avallonis, Old French Avalon, Welsh: Ynys Afallon, Ynys Afallach; literally meaning \"the isle of fruit [or apple] trees\") is a legendary island featured in the Arthurian legend. It first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's 1136 pseudo-historical account Historia Regum Britanniae (\"The History of the Kings of Britain\") as the place where King Arthur's sword Excalibur was forged and later where Arthur was taken to recover from his wounds after the Battle of Camlann. Avalon was associated from an early date with mystical practices and people such as Morgan le Fay.Geoffrey of Monmouth referred to it in Latin as Insula Avallonis in the Historia. In the later Vita Merlini he called it Insula Pomorum the \"isle of fruit trees\" (from Latin pōmus \"fruit tree\"). The name is generally considered to be of Welsh origin (though an Old Cornish or Old Breton origin is also possible), derived from Old Welsh, Old Cornish, or Old Breton aball or avallen(n), \"apple tree, fruit tree\" (cf. afall in Modern Welsh, derived from Common Celtic *abalnā).[1][2][3][4][5] It is also possible that the tradition of an \"apple\" island among the British was influenced by Irish legends concerning the otherworld island home of Manannán mac Lir and Lugh, Emain Ablach (also the Old Irish poetic name for the Isle of Man),[2] where Ablach means \"Having Apple Trees\"[6] – derived from Old Irish aball (\"apple\")—and is similar to the Middle Welsh name Afallach, which was used to replace the name Avalon in medieval Welsh translations of French and Latin Arthurian tales. All are etymologically related to the Gaulish root *aballo- (as found in the place name Aballo/Aballone, now Avallon in Burgundy or in the Italian surname Avallone) and are derived from a Common Celtic *abal- \"apple\", which is related at the Proto-Indo-European level to English apple, Russian яблоко (jabloko), Latvian ābele, et al.[7][8]According to Geoffrey in the Historia and much subsequent literature which he inspired, Avalon is the place where King Arthur is taken after fighting Mordred at the Battle of Camlann to recover from his wounds. Welsh, Cornish and Breton tradition claimed that Arthur had never really died, but would inexorably return to lead his people against their enemies. The Historia also states that Avalon is where his sword Excalibur was forged. Geoffrey dealt with Avalon in more detail in Vita Merlini, in which he describes for the first time in Arthurian legend the enchantress Morgan le Fay as the chief of nine sisters (Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, Thiten and Thiton)[9] who live on Avalon. Geoffrey's description of the island indicates a sea voyage was needed to get there. His description of Avalon here, which is heavily indebted to the early medieval Spanish scholar Isidore of Seville (being mostly derived from the section on famous islands in Isidore's famous work Etymologiae, XIV.6.8 \"Fortunatae Insulae\"), shows the magical nature of the island:By comparison, Isidore's description of the Fortunate Isles reads:In medieval geographies, Isidore's Fortunate Islands were identified with the Canaries.[12][13][14][15]Around 1190, Avalon became associated with Glastonbury, when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have discovered the bones of Arthur and his queen. The works of Gerald of Wales make the first known connection:Though no longer an island in the twelfth century, the high conical bulk of Glastonbury Tor had been surrounded by marsh before the surrounding fenland in the Somerset Levels was drained. In ancient times, Ponter's Ball Dyke would have guarded the only entrance to the island. The Romans eventually built another road to the island.[17] Gerald wrote that Glastonbury's earliest name in Welsh was Ineswitrin (or Ynys Witrin), the Isle of glass, a name noted by earlier historians which suggests that the location was at one point seen as an island. The discovery of the burial is described by chroniclers, notably Gerald of Wales, as being just after King Henry II's reign when the new abbot of Glastonbury, Henry de Sully, commissioned a search of the abbey grounds. At a depth of 5 m (16 feet) the monks were said to have discovered a massive treetrunk coffin and a leaden cross bearing the inscription:Accounts of the exact inscription vary, with five different versions existing. The earliest is by Gerald in \"Liber de Principis instructione\" c. 1193, who wrote that he viewed the cross in person and traced the lettering. His transcript reads: \"Here lies buried the famous King Arthur (\"Arthurus\") with Guinevere (\"Wenneveria\") his second wife in the isle of Avalon\". Inside the coffin were two bodies, who Giraldus refers to as Arthur and \"his queen\"; the bones of the male body were described as being gigantic. The account of the burial by the chronicle of Margam Abbey says three bodies were found, the other being of Mordred.[18] In 1278, the remains were reburied with great ceremony, attended by King Edward I and his queen, before the High Altar at Glastonbury Abbey, where they were the focus of pilgrimages until the Reformation.The story is today seen as an example of pseudoarchaeology. Historians today generally dismiss the authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184.[19] Long before this William of Malmesbury, a historian interested in Arthur, said in his history of England \"But Arthur’s grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return.\"[20] As William wrote a comprehensive history of Glastonbury De antiquitae Glatoniensis ecclesie around 1130 which discussed many pious legends connected to the Abbey, but made no mention of either Arthur's grave or a connection of Glastonbury to the name Avalon, stating firmly it was previously known as Ineswitrin, this raises further suspicions concerning the burial. It is known for certain the monks later added forged passages to William's history discussing Arthurian connections.[21] The fact that the search for the body is connected to Henry II and Edward I, both kings who fought major Welsh wars, has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well.[22] Gerald, a constant supporter of royal authority, in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of King's Arthur's messianic return: \"Many tales are told and many legends have been invented about King Arthur and his mysterious ending. In their stupidity the British [i.e. Welsh, Cornish and Bretons] people maintain that he is still alive. Now that the truth is known, I have taken the trouble to add a few more details in this present chapter. The fairy-tales have been snuffed out, and the true and indubitable facts are made known, so that what really happened must be made crystal clear to all and separated from the myths which have accumulated on the subject.\"[23]The burial discovery ensured that in later romances, histories based on them and in the popular imagination Glastonbury became increasingly identified with Avalon, an identification that continues strongly today. The later development of the legends of the Holy Grail and Joseph of Arimathea by Robert de Boron interconnected these legends with Glastonbury and with Avalon, an identification which also seems to be made in Perlesvaus. The popularity of Arthurian Romance has meant this area of the Somerset Levels has today become popularly described as The Vale of Avalon.[24] In more recent times writers such as Dion Fortune, John Michell, Nicholas Mann and Geoffrey Ashe have formed theories based on perceived connections between Glastonbury and Celtic legends of the otherworld and Annwn in attempts to link the location firmly with Avalon, drawing on the various legends based on Glastonbury Tor as well as drawing on ideas like Earth mysteries, Ley lines and even the myth of Atlantis. Arthurian literature also continues to use Glastonbury as an important location as in The Mists of Avalon, A Glastonbury Romance and The Bones of Avalon. Even the fact that Somerset has many apple orchards has been drawn in to support the connection. Glastonbury's connection to Avalon continues to make it a site of tourism and the area has great religious significance for Neopagans, Neo-druids and as a New Age community, as well as Christians. Hippy identification of Glastonbury with Avalon seen in the work of Michell and in Gandalf's Garden also helped inspire the Glastonbury Festival.[25]In medieval times suggestions for the location of Avalon ranged far beyond Glastonbury. They included on the other side of the Earth at the antipodes, Sicily, and other unnamed locations in the Mediterranean.[26]In more recent times, just like in the quest for Arthur's mythical capital Camelot, a large number of locations have been put forward as being the real \"Avalon\". Geoffrey Ashe suggests an association of Avalon with the town of Avallon in Burgundy, as part of a theory connecting King Arthur to the Romano-British leader Riothamus who campaigned in that area.[27]","path":[81851,-9.049223,53.27002,80591,-9.049225,53.27003,79331,-9.049243,53.27001,78071,-9.049235,53.27001,76811,-9.049245,53.27002,75551,-9.049243,53.27001,74291,-9.049232,53.27003,73031,-9.049249,53.27002,71591,-9.04923,53.27002,69791,-9.04925,53.27001,68531,-9.049243,53.27003,67271,-9.04926,53.27001,66011,-9.049258,53.26999,64751,-9.049236,53.27002,63491,-9.049243,53.27001,62231,-9.049253,53.27,60971,-9.049216,53.27,59711,-9.049235,53.27001,58451,-9.049233,53.27,57191,-9.049252,53.26999,55751,-9.049243,53.27002,54491,-9.049258,53.27,53231,-9.049265,53.27004,51791,-9.049207,53.27,50531,-9.049236,53.27,49271,-9.049225,53.26999,48011,-9.049213,53.26999,46751,-9.049233,53.27,45491,-9.049227,53.27,44231,-9.04924,53.27001,42971,-9.049225,53.27003,41711,-9.049252,53.27004,40451,-9.049238,53.27002,39191,-9.049232,53.27001,37931,-9.049229,53.27002,36671,-9.049222,53.27003,35411,-9.04923,53.27001,34175,-9.050007,53.27013,33895,-9.050709,53.26998,33744,-9.050457,53.2701,33612,-9.049896,53.27003,33364,-9.048748,53.26951,33095,-9.046008,53.26775,32965,-9.044805,53.26652,32744,-9.041377,53.26392,32606,-9.038604,53.26174,32463,-9.036306,53.25937,32335,-9.037438,53.25646,32145,-9.040577,53.25197,31954,-9.04719,53.24879,31816,-9.052275,53.24675,31685,-9.056437,53.24515,31565,-9.059658,53.24398,31433,-9.063962,53.24229,31235,-9.073605,53.23726,31109,-9.07375,53.23473,30109,-9.0735,53.23499,28848,-9.073443,53.23499,28847,-9.073443,53.23499,27588,-9.073475,53.23505,26327,-9.073553,53.235,25068,-9.073602,53.23509,23808,-9.073578,53.23504,22548,-9.073578,53.23505,21288,-9.07361,53.23512,21287,-9.07361,53.23512,20028,-9.07361,53.2351,18768,-9.073624,53.2351,17508,-9.073702,53.23515,16248,-9.073758,53.2352,14988,-9.073771,53.23522,13728,-9.073809,53.23521,12468,-9.073905,53.23528,11208,-9.07354,53.23496,9948,-9.073465,53.23483,8688,-9.073564,53.23497,7428,-9.074045,53.23521,6168,-9.073894,53.23522,4908,-9.073695,53.23438,3648,-9.07424,53.23417,2387,-9.073763,53.23434,1127,-9.073512,53.23466]},{"name":"GALWAY PILOT VESSEL","text":"GALWAY PILOT VESSEL:The page \"GALWAY PILOT VESSEL\" does not exist. The Galway hooker (Irish: húicéir) is a traditional fishing boat used in Galway Bay off the west coast of Ireland. The hooker was developed for the strong seas there. It is identified by its sharp, clean entry, bluff bow, marked tumblehome and raked transom. Its sail plan consists of a single mast with a main sail and two foresails. Traditionally, the boat is black (being coated in pitch) and the sails are a dark red-brown.Recently there has been a major revival, and renewed interest in the Galway hooker, and the boats are still being painstakingly constructed. The festival of Cruinniú na mBád is held each year, when boats race across Galway Bay from Connemara to Kinvara on the Galway/Clare county boundary.Classes of Galway Hooker: Galway hooker under sail at Belfast Titanic Maritime Festival, Queen's Quay, Belfast, Northern Ireland, June 2010. The hooker refers to four classes of boats. All are named in Irish. The Bád Mór (big boats) ranges in length from 10.5 to 13.5 metres (35 to 44 feet). The smaller Leathbhád (half boat) is about 10 metres (28 feet) in length. Both the Bád Mór and Leathbhád were decked forward of the mast. These boats were used to carry turf to be used as fuel across Galway Bay from Connemara and County Mayo to the Aran Islands and the Burren. The boats often brought limestone on the return journeys, to neutralise the acid soils of Connemara and Mayo. The Gleoiteog ranges in length from 7 to 9 metres (24 to 28 feet) and has the same sails and rigging as the larger boats. They were used for fishing and carrying cargo. Another boat, the Púcán, is similar in size to the Gleoiteog but has a lug mainsail and a foresail. These smaller boats were entirely open.There was also a class fitted with a cockpit floor over the ballast used for fishing. When the Irish settlers at Boston USA needed fishing craft, they built the hooker that they knew from home. These boats became known as Boston Hookers, Irish Cutters in official reports, or Paddy Boats.While a very utilitarian boat, well suited for the shallow waters of Galway Bay and being capable of being beached where necessary, the Galway Hooker is prone to being swamped and sinking in a short time in the absence of a cabin and high freeboard. Eighty-two shipwrecks are recorded in the unpublished Shipwreck Inventory of Wrecks for Galway Bay. These eighty-two wrecks date to between 1750 and 1938 and of these, 59, are from the 19th century. No records currently exists for the period prior to the 18th century. Cargo throughout this period would usually be held in wooden casks varnished with fish oil for waterproofing.","path":[53992,-9.048054,53.26915,53752,-9.047852,53.26929,41561,-9.047853,53.26931,40301,-9.047985,53.26917,39040,-9.047998,53.26924,38908,-9.047783,53.26892,37649,-9.047789,53.26891,36330,-9.047883,53.26929,34250,-9.047894,53.26933,34100,-9.050529,53.26997,33986,-9.050682,53.27032,33853,-9.050756,53.27025,33792,-9.05064,53.27057,33712,-9.05064,53.27057,33552,-9.050814,53.27042,33433,-9.050755,53.2704,33233,-9.048993,53.26944,32834,-9.048489,53.26869,32684,-9.047105,53.26833,32473,-9.043732,53.26511,32298,-9.039815,53.26106,32084,-9.040272,53.2552,31935,-9.04179,53.25257,31814,-9.04697,53.25039,31605,-9.057055,53.24588,31365,-9.061387,53.2441,31216,-9.054111,53.24701,31066,-9.048088,53.25031,31065,-9.048088,53.25031,30825,-9.039786,53.25746,30644,-9.042202,53.26423,30495,-9.047611,53.2688,30385,-9.047905,53.26929,29999,-9.048083,53.26921,29714,-9.04792,53.26929,28135,-9.047875,53.26927,26903,-9.04793,53.2693,26824,-9.04793,53.2693]},{"name":"SKIPPER","text":"SKIPPER:Skipper or skippers may refer to:A skipper is a person who has command of a boat or sea-craft or tug, more or less equivalent to \"captain in charge aboard ship.\" At sea, or upon lakes and rivers, the skipper as shipmaster or captain has command over the whole crew. The skipper may or may not be the owner of the boat.The word is derived from the Dutch word schipper; schip is Dutch for \"ship\". In Dutch sch- is pronounced [sx] and English-speakers rendered this as [sk]. The word \"skipper\" is used more than \"captain\" for some types of craft, for example fishing boats.It is also more frequently used than captain with privately owned noncommercial or semi-commercial vessels, such as small yachts and other recreational boats, mostly in cases where the person in command of the boat may not be a licensed or professional captain, suggesting the term is less formal. In the U.S., a \"skipper\" who is in command of a charter vessel that carries paying passengers must be licensed by a state or the USCG. If the vessel carries over six paying passengers, it must be an \"inspected vessel\" and a higher class license must be obtained by the skipper/master depending on the vessel's gross tons.In the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and merchant naval slang, it is a term used in reference to the commanding officer of any ship, base, or other command regardless of rank. It is generally only applied to someone who has earned the speaker's respect, and only used with the permission of the commander/commanding officer in question.Skipper RNR was an actual rank used in the British Royal Naval Reserve for skippers of fishing boats who were members of the service. It was equivalent to Warrant Officer. Skippers could also be promoted to Chief Skipper RNR (equivalent to Commissioned Warrant Officer) and Skipper Lieutenant RNR.\n\n","path":[39283,-9.05085,53.27047,37933,-9.05085,53.27047,36583,-9.050867,53.27045,35312,-9.050867,53.27045,33972,-9.05085,53.27045,32553,-9.050867,53.27045,31283,-9.05085,53.27043,31142,-9.0508,53.27045,30923,-9.047767,53.26895,30703,-9.044117,53.26632,30554,-9.041717,53.26467,30392,-9.03935,53.2628,30152,-9.03725,53.2598,30023,-9.03665,53.25805,29842,-9.036917,53.25523,29716,-9.038466,53.25297,29582,-9.042,53.25125,29443,-9.045816,53.24958,29304,-9.049983,53.24815,29172,-9.053917,53.2469,29043,-9.057783,53.24558,28912,-9.061584,53.24435,28762,-9.065917,53.2429,28641,-9.069266,53.24168,28502,-9.07325,53.24028,28373,-9.076983,53.23898,28183,-9.0816,53.23722,28042,-9.084784,53.23567,27869,-9.087684,53.23355,27721,-9.088217,53.23337,27573,-9.08885,53.23342,27381,-9.089817,53.23347,27151,-9.090883,53.23352,26912,-9.091784,53.23355,26692,-9.092716,53.23357,26453,-9.093516,53.23355,26216,-9.094267,53.23318,25972,-9.097867,53.23215,25732,-9.1028,53.23113,25471,-9.108133,53.23018,25291,-9.11175,53.22952,25161,-9.114367,53.22906,25031,-9.117017,53.22861,24822,-9.121166,53.22782,24582,-9.1259,53.22692,24432,-9.128866,53.22632,24312,-9.131166,53.22583,24112,-9.135067,53.22488,23882,-9.1397,53.22393,23762,-9.142183,53.2235,23651,-9.144433,53.2231,23532,-9.1469,53.22273,23413,-9.149283,53.22227,23302,-9.151533,53.22192,23122,-9.15555,53.22122,22993,-9.158633,53.22072,22862,-9.161716,53.22015,22733,-9.1648,53.21962,22543,-9.169367,53.21887,22352,-9.1739,53.21808,22223,-9.177033,53.21758,22093,-9.180567,53.21707,21942,-9.184733,53.21646,21760,-9.189716,53.21572,21622,-9.193583,53.21522,21493,-9.19715,53.2147,21371,-9.200483,53.21423,21241,-9.204083,53.21372,21092,-9.20825,53.2131,20954,-9.21215,53.21258,20822,-9.21585,53.21205,20701,-9.219234,53.21157,20571,-9.22285,53.21105,20383,-9.2281,53.21025,20191,-9.233533,53.20955,20064,-9.237683,53.20895,19942,-9.242117,53.20833,19813,-9.247167,53.20763,19684,-9.252483,53.20688,19554,-9.257816,53.20615,19362,-9.26565,53.20502,19213,-9.271667,53.20405,19073,-9.277384,53.20327,18880,-9.285116,53.20207,18732,-9.29115,53.20152,18523,-9.299583,53.20073,18383,-9.30525,53.20025,18251,-9.31045,53.19975,18124,-9.315583,53.19933,18002,-9.320933,53.19883,17811,-9.3296,53.19857,17621,-9.338284,53.19827,17464,-9.341866,53.1982,17292,-9.353316,53.19785,17104,-9.358267,53.19777,16892,-9.371417,53.19743,16812,-9.371417,53.19743,16683,-9.380783,53.19727,16533,-9.387484,53.19728,16440,-9.39155,53.19732,16361,-9.39155,53.19732,15683,-9.421583,53.19717,12851,-9.548767,53.19773,12731,-9.55385,53.19812,12432,-9.566533,53.199,10851,-9.632983,53.2029,9352,-9.695,53.20012,9022,-9.7083,53.199,8431,-9.732017,53.1968,8251,-9.739217,53.19613,8111,-9.74485,53.19557,7981,-9.7501,53.19503,7831,-9.7562,53.19445,7682,-9.76235,53.19383,7532,-9.768917,53.19333,7372,-9.775983,53.1927,7212,-9.783267,53.1922,6992,-9.79325,53.19158,6851,-9.7996,53.19123,6632,-9.8094,53.19065,6492,-9.81535,53.18955,6352,-9.8213,53.18845,6203,-9.8275,53.18718,6062,-9.833366,53.18604,5911,-9.8396,53.18478,5762,-9.8457,53.18345,5552,-9.854183,53.18158,5402,-9.86025,53.18027,5192,-9.86865,53.17838,5042,-9.87465,53.17703,4891,-9.880716,53.1757,4751,-9.886333,53.17442,4621,-9.8915,53.17318,4471,-9.897367,53.17183,4312,-9.9036,53.1704,4152,-9.909883,53.16897,3992,-9.916083,53.16751,3851,-9.9216,53.1663,3702,-9.927383,53.16497,3541,-9.9336,53.16352,3391,-9.9394,53.16217,3251,-9.944817,53.16093,3102,-9.950767,53.1598,2962,-9.95635,53.15875,2811,-9.96245,53.15762,2652,-9.968817,53.15642,2492,-9.975217,53.15515,2352,-9.980766,53.15396,2212,-9.98615,53.15282,2062,-9.991867,53.15158,1921,-9.997283,53.1504,1711,-10.00532,53.14867,1571,-10.01063,53.1474,1430,-10.01603,53.14615,1282,-10.02175,53.14482,1141,-10.02715,53.14355,992,-10.033,53.14228,851,-10.03858,53.14107,702,-10.0444,53.1398,561,-10.04997,53.13868,412,-10.05587,53.13743,252,-10.06213,53.13612,32,-10.07078,53.13438]},{"name":"CARMAROSE","text":"CARMAROSE:Viscount Camrose, of Hackwood Park in the County of Southampton, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

He had already been created a Baronet, of Hackwood Park in the County of Southampton, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom, on 4 July 1921, and Baron Camrose, of Long Cross in the County of Surrey, on 19 June 1929, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His second son, the third Viscount, disclaimed the peerages in 1995 on succeeding his elder brother. However, he had already been created a life peer as Baron Hartwell, of Peterborough Court in the City of London, in 1968. On his death in 2001 the life peerage became extinct while he was succeeded in the other titles by his eldest son, the fourth Viscount. The first three Viscounts all headed The Daily Telegraph at one point, the first having purchased it from Harry Levy-Lawson, 1st Viscount Burnham, but in the 1980s they lost control to Conrad Black. The first Viscount was the younger brother of the industrialist Henry Berry, 1st Baron Buckland, and the elder brother of fellow press lord Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount

Columba (Irish: Colm Cille, 'church dove';[a][1][2] 7 December 521 – 9 June 597) was an Irish abbot and missionary credited with spreading Christianity in what is today Scotland at the start of the Hiberno-Scottish mission. He founded the important abbey on Iona, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of Derry. He was highly regarded by both the Gaels of Dál Riata and the Picts, and is remembered today as a Christian saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland.[3]Columba studied under some of Ireland's most prominent church figures and founded several monasteries in the country. Around 563 he and his twelve companions crossed to Dunaverty near Southend, Argyll in Kintyre before settling in Iona in Scotland, then part of the Ulster kingdom of Dál Riata, where they founded a new abbey as a base for spreading Christianity among the northern Pictish kingdoms[4][5] who were pagan. He remained active in Irish politics, though he spent most of the remainder of his life in Scotland. Three surviving early medieval Latin hymns may be attributed to him.[6]Columba was born to Fedlimid and Eithne of the Cenel Conaill in Gartan, near Lough Gartan, in modern County Donegal, in Ireland. On his father's side, he was great-great-grandson of Niall of the Nine Hostages, an Irish high king of the 5th century. He was baptised in Temple-Douglas, in the County Donegal parish of Conwal (midway between Gartan and Letterkenny), by his teacher and foster-uncle Saint Crunathan.[7][8][9] It is not known for sure if his name at birth was Columba or if he adopted this name later in life; Adomnan of Iona thought it was his birth name but other Irish sources have claimed his name at birth was Crimthann (meaning 'fox').[10] In the Irish language his name means 'dove', which is the same name as the Prophet Jonah (Jonah in Hebrew is also 'dove'), which Adomnan of Iona as well as other early Irish writers were aware of,[10] although it is not clear if he was deliberately named after Jonah or not.When sufficiently advanced in letters he entered the monastic school of Movilla, at Newtownards, under St. Finnian who had studied at St. Ninian's \"Magnum Monasterium\" on the shores of Galloway. He was about twenty, and a deacon when, having completed his training at Movilla, he travelled southwards into Leinster, where he became a pupil of an aged bard named Gemman. On leaving him, Columba entered the monastery of Clonard, governed at that time by Finnian, noted for sanctity and learning. Here he imbibed the traditions of the Welsh Church, for Finnian had been trained in the schools of St. David.[11]In early Christian Ireland the druidic tradition collapsed due to the spread of the new Christian faith. The study of Latin learning and Christian theology in monasteries flourished. Columba became a pupil at the monastic school at Clonard Abbey, situated on the River Boyne in modern County Meath. During the sixth century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish Christianity studied at the Clonard monastery. It is said that the average number of scholars under instruction at Clonard was 3,000.[3] Columba was one of twelve students of St. Finnian who became known as the Twelve Apostles of Ireland. He became a monk and eventually was ordained a priest.Another preceptor of Columba was St. Mobhi, whose monastery at Glasnevin was frequented by such famous men as St. Canice, St. Comgall, and St. Ciaran. A pestilence which devastated Ireland in 544 caused the dispersion of Mobhi's disciples, and Columba returned to Ulster, the land of his kindred. He was a striking figure of great stature and powerful build, with a loud, melodious voice which could be heard from one hilltop to another.[12] The following years were marked by the foundation of several important monasteries, Derry, County Londonderry; Durrow, County Offaly; Kells, County Meath; and Swords.[13] While at Derry it is said that he planned a pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem, but did not proceed farther than Tours. Thence he brought a copy of those gospels that had lain on the bosom of St. Martin for the space of 100 years. This relic was deposited in Derry.[11]Tradition asserts that, sometime around 560, he became involved in a quarrel with Saint Finnian of Movilla Abbey over a psalter. Columba copied the manuscript at the scriptorium under Saint Finnian, intending to keep the copy. Saint Finnian disputed his right to keep the copy. The dispute eventually led to the pitched Battle of Cúl Dreimhne in Cairbre Drom Cliabh (now in County Sligo) in 561, during which many men were killed. A second grievance that led him to induce the clan Neill to rise and engage in battle against King Diarmait at Cooldrevny in 561 was the king's violation of the right of sanctuary belonging to Columba's person as a monk on the occasion of the murder of Prince Curnan, the saint's kinsman.[11] Prince Curnan of Connaught, who had fatally injured a rival in a hurling match and had taken refuge with Columba, was dragged from his protector's arms and slain by Diarmaid's men, in defiance of the rights of sanctuary.[12]A synod of clerics and scholars threatened to excommunicate him for these deaths, but St. Brendan of Birr spoke on his behalf with the result that he was allowed to go into exile instead. Columba's own conscience was uneasy, and on the advice of an aged hermit, Molaise, he resolved to expiate his offence by going into exile and win for Christ as many souls as had perished in the terrible battle of Cúl Dreimhne. He left Ireland, to return only once, many years later. Columba's copy of the psalter has been traditionally associated with the Cathach of St. Columba.In 563, he travelled to Scotland with twelve companions (said to include Odran of Iona) in a wicker currach covered with leather. According to legend he first landed on the Kintyre Peninsula, near Southend. However, being still in sight of his native land, he moved farther north up the west coast of Scotland. The island of Iona was made over to him by his kinsman Conall mac Comgaill King of Dál Riata, who perhaps had invited him to come to Scotland in the first place.[12] However, there is a sense in which he was not leaving his native people, as the Ulster Gaels had been colonising the west coast of Scotland for the previous couple of centuries.[14] Aside from the services he provided guiding the only centre of literacy in the region, his reputation as a holy man led to his role as a diplomat among the tribes.[15] There are also many stories of miracles which he performed during his work to convert the Picts, the most famous being his encounter with an unidentified animal that some have equated with the Loch Ness Monster in 565. It is said that he banished a ferocious \"water beast\" to the depths of the River Ness after it had killed a Pict and then tried to attack Columba's disciple (see Vita Columbae Book 2 below). He visited the pagan King Bridei, King of Fortriu, at his base in Inverness, winning Bridei's respect, although not his conversion. He subsequently played a major role in the politics of the country. He was also very energetic in his work as a missionary, and, in addition to founding several churches in the Hebrides, he worked to turn his monastery at Iona into a school for missionaries. He was a renowned man of letters, having written several hymns and being credited with having transcribed 300 books. One of the few, if not the only, times he left Scotland was towards the end of his life, when he returned to Ireland to found the monastery at Durrow.Columba died on Iona and was buried in 597 by his monks in the abbey he created. In 794 the Vikings descended on Iona. Columba's relics were finally removed in 849 and divided between Scotland and Ireland.[16] The parts of the relics which went to Ireland are reputed to be buried in Downpatrick, County Down, with St. Patrick and St. Brigid or at Saul Church neighbouring Downpatrick. (Names of Iona), Inchcolm and Eilean Chaluim Chille.Saint Columba is one of the three chief saints of Ireland, after saint Patrick and saint Brigit of Kildare. Columba is the patron-saint of the city of Derry, where he founded a monastic settlement in c. 540. The name of the city in Irish is Doire Colmcille and is derived from the native oak trees in the area and the city's association with Columba. The Catholic Church of Saint Columba's Long Tower, and the Church of Ireland St Augustine's Church both claim to stand at the spot of this original settlement. The Church of Ireland Cathedral in Derry is dedicated to St Columba. St. Colmcilles Primary School[17] and St. Colmcilles Community School[18] are two schools in Knocklyon, Dublin, named after St. Colmcille, with the former having an annual day dedicated to the saint on 9 June. The Columba Press, a religious and spiritual book company based in Dublin, is named after St. Columba. Aer Lingus, Ireland's national flag carrier has named one of its Airbus A330 aircraft in commemoration of the saint (reg: EI-DUO).Columba is credited as being a leading figure in the revitalisation of monasticism. The Clan Malcom/Clan McCallum claims its name from Columba and was reputedly founded by the descendants of his original followers. It is also said that Clan Robertson are heirs of Columba. Clan MacKinnon may also have some claim to being spiritual descendants of St Columcille as after he founded his monastery on Isle Iona, the MacKinnons were the abbots of the Church for centuries. This would also account for the fact that Clan MacKinnon is amongst the ancient clans of Scotland.[19]The cathedral of the Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles is placed under the patronage of St. Columba, as are numerous Catholic schools and parishes throughout the nation. The Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church of Scotland, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of England also have parishes dedicated to him. The village of Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire is also derived from Columba's name.Saint Columba currently has two poems attributed to him: \"Adiutor Laborantium\" and \"Altus Prosator\".[20] Both poems are examples of Abecedarian hymns in Latin written while Columba was at the Iona Abbey.The shorter of the two poems, \"Adiutor Laborantium\" consists of twenty-seven lines of eight syllables each, with each line following the format of an Abecedarian hymn using the Classical Latin alphabet save for lines 10-11 and 25-27. The content of the poem addresses God as a helper, ruler, guard, defender and lifter for those who are good and an enemy of sinners whom he will punish.[21]\"Altus Prosator\" consists of twenty-three stanzas sixteen syllables long, with the first containing seven lines and six lines in each subsequent stanza. It uses the same format and alphabet as \"Adiutor Laborantium\" except with each stanza starting with a different letter rather than each line. The poem tells a story over three parts split into the beginning of time, history of Creation, and the Apocalypse or end of time.[22]As of 2011, Canadians who are of Scottish ancestry are the third largest ethnic group in the country and thus Columba's name is to be found attached to Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian parishes. This is particularly the case in eastern Canada apart from Quebec which is French-speaking.Throughout the US there are numerous parishes within the Catholic and Episcopalian denominations dedicated to Columba. Within the Protestant tradition the Presbyterian Church (which has its roots in Scottish Presbyterianism) also has parishes named in honour of Columba. There is even an Orthodox Church monastery dedicated to the saint in the Massachusetts town of Southbridge. St. Columba is the Patron Saint of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown, OH. The Cathedral there is named for him.Iona College, a small Catholic liberal arts college in New Rochelle, NY, is named after the island on which Columba established his first monastery in Scotland, as is Iona College in Windsor, Ontario and Iona Presentation College, Perth.There are at least four pipe bands named for him; one each from Tullamore, Ireland,[23] from Derry, Northern Ireland,[24] from Kearny, New Jersey,[25] and from Cape Cod, Massachusetts.[26]St. Columba's School one of the most prominent English-Medium schools in Delhi run by the Irish Christian Brothers is also named after the Saint.The Munich GAA is named München Colmcilles.[27]St. Columba's Feast Day, 9 June, has been designated as International Celtic Art Day. The Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow, great medieval masterpieces of Celtic art, are associated with Columba. [28]The main source of information about Saint Columba's life is the Vita Columbae (i.e. \"Life of Columba\"), a hagiography written in the style of \"saint's lives\" narratives that had become widespread throughout medieval Europe. Compiled and drafted by scribes and clergymen, these accounts were written in Latin and served as written collections of the deeds and miracles attributed to the saint, both during his or her life or after death. The canonization of a saint, especially one who had lived on the fringes of the medieval Christian world like Saint Columba, required a well-written hagiography to be submitted to Rome, but popular belief and local cults of sainthood often led to the veneration of these men and women without official approval from the Catholic Church.Writing a century after the death of Saint Columba, the author Adomnán (also known as Eunan), served as the ninth Abbot of Iona until his death in 704 A.D.[29]James Earle Fraser asserts that Adomnán drew extensively from an existing body of accounts regarding the life of Saint Columba, including a Latin collection entitled \"De uirtutibus sancti Columbae\", composed c. 640 A.D. This earlier work is attributed to Cummene Find, who became the abbot of Iona and served as the leader of the monastic island community from 656 until his death in 668 A.D. or 669 A.D.[30]While the Vita Columbae often conflicts with contemporaneous accounts of various battles, figures, and dates, it remains the most important surviving work from early medieval Scotland and provides a wealth of knowledge regarding the Picts and other ethnic and political groups from this time period. The Vita also offers a valuable insight into the monastic practices of Iona and the daily life of the early medieval Gaelic monks.The surviving manuscripts include:Instead of relying on chronological order, Adomnán categorises the events recorded in the Vita Columbae into three different books: Columba’s Prophecies, Columba’s Miracles, and Columba’s Apparitions.[32]In the first book, the author Adomnán lists Saint Columba's prophetic revelations, which come as a result of the saint's ability to view the present and the future simultaneously. Most of the short chapters begin with Saint Columba informing his fellow monks that a person will soon arrive on the island or an event will imminently occur.In one notable instance, Columba appears in a dream to King Oswald of Northumbria, and announces the king's incoming victory against the King Catlon (Cadwallon of Wales) in the Battle of Heavenfield. The people of Britain promise to convert to Christianity and receive baptism after the conclusion of the war. This victory signals the re-Christianization of pagan England, and establishes King Oswald as ruler of the entirety of Britain.Columba's other prophecies can be considered vindictive at times, as when he sends a man named Batain off to perform his penance, but then Columba turns to his friends and says Batain will instead return to Scotia and be killed by his enemies. Several of Saint Columba's prophecies reflect the scribal culture in which he was immersed, such his miraculous knowledge of the missing letter \"I” from Baithene's psalter or when he prophecies that an eager man will knock over his inkhorn and spill its contents.[33]In the second book, Columba performs various miracles such as healing people with diseases, expelling malignant spirits, subduing wild beasts, calming storms, and even returning the dead to life. They have also made many schools in honour of St.Columba, one was founded by the Sisters of Charity.He also performs agricultural miracles that would hold a special significance to the common people of Ireland and the British Isles, such as when he casts a demon out of a pail and restores the spilt milk to its container.The Vita contains a story that has been interpreted as the first reference to the Loch Ness Monster. According to Adomnán, Columba came across a group of Picts burying a man who had been killed by the monster. Columba saves a swimmer from the monster with the sign of the Cross and the imprecation, \"Thou shalt go no further, nor touch the man; go back with all speed.\" The beast flees, terrified, to the amazement of the assembled Picts who glorified Columba's God. Whether or not this incident is true, Adomnan's text specifically states that the monster was swimming in the River Ness – the river flowing from the loch – rather than in Loch Ness itself.[34]In book three, Adomnán describes different apparitions of the Saint, both that Columba receives and those that are seen by others regarding him. He mentions that, \"For indeed after the lapse of many years, ... St. Columba was excommunicated by a certain synod for some pardonable and very trifling reasons, and indeed unjustly\" (P.79- 80).In one of the accounts, Saint Columba, in this period of excommunication, goes to a meeting held against him in Teilte. Saint Brendan, despite of all the negative reactions among the seniors toward Columba, kisses him reverently and assures that Columba is the man of God and that he sees Holy Angels accompanying Columba on his journey through the plain.[35]In the last Chapter, Columba foresees his own death when speaking to his attendant:This day in the Holy Scriptures is called the Sabbath, which means rest. And this day is indeed a Sabbath to me, for it is the last day of my present laborious life, and on it I rest after the fatigues of my labours; and this night at midnight, which commenceth the solemn Lord's Day, I shall, according to the sayings of Scripture, go the way of our fathers. For already my Lord Jesus Christ deigneth to invite me; and to Him, I say, in the middle of this night shall I depart, at His invitation. For so it hath been revealed to me by the Lord himself.And when the bell strikes midnight, Columba goes to the church and kneels beside the altar. His attendant witnesses heavenly light in the direction of Columba, and Holy angels join the saint in his passage to the Lord:And having given them his holy benediction in this way, he immediately breathed his last. After his soul had left the tabernacle of the body, his face still continued ruddy, and brightened in a wonderful way by his vision of the angels, and that to such a degree that he had the appearance, not so much of one dead, as of one alive and sleeping.[36]Both the Vita Columbae and the Venerable Bede (672/673-735) record Columba's visit to Bridei. Whereas Adomnán just tells us that Columba visited Bridei, Bede relates a later, perhaps Pictish tradition, whereby the saint actually converts the Pictish king. Another early source is a poem in praise of Columba, most probably commissioned by Columba's kinsman, the King of the Uí Néill clan. It was almost certainly written within three or four years of Columba's death and is the earliest vernacular poem in European history. It consists of 25 stanzas of four verses of seven syllables each.[citation needed]Through the reputation of its venerable founder and its position as a major European centre of learning, Columba's Iona became a place of pilgrimage. Columba is historically revered as a warrior saint, and was often invoked for victory in battle.[citation needed] His relics were finally removed in 849 and divided between Alba and Ireland. Relics of Columba were carried before Scottish armies in the reliquary made at Iona in the mid-8th century, called the Brecbennoch. Legend has it that the Brecbennoch was carried to the Battle of Bannockburn (24 June 1314) by the vastly outnumbered Scots army and the intercession of Columba helped them to victory. It is widely thought[by whom?] that the Monymusk Reliquary is the object in question.[citation needed]In the Antiphoner of Inchcolm Abbey, the \"Iona of the East\" (situated on an island in the Firth of Forth), a 13th-century prayer begins O Columba spes Scotorum... \"O Columba, hope of the Scots\".[citation

The town is situated at the head of a scenic harbour and at the base of a vast mountainous tract extending northward.[1] In the summer, there is a street festival celebrating the fish catches and incorporating the traditional \"Blessing of the Boats\". It has a population of 1,297.History: In 1588, Killybegs was the last port of call for the Spanish vessel La Girona, which had dropped anchor in the harbour when the Spanish Armada fetched up on the Irish coast during Spain's war with England. With the assistance of a Killybegs chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, the Girona's personnel were fed, her rudder repaired, and she set sail for Scotland, but was wrecked off the Antrim coast with the loss of nearly 1,300 lives.Fishing industry: Killybegs is a natural deepwater harbour with a depth of 12 meters at low water spring tide at the new €50 million pier completed in 2004. The harbour is home to all the largest Irish midwater pelagic trawlers, and a modest whitefish fleet, but it handles many other types of shipping as well. These include passenger cruise liners and mixed specialist cargoes. In recent years Killybegs has become the favoured port for the importation of wind turbines, and is a service port for the offshore gas/oil drilling rigs.The town is the centre of the Irish pelagic fishing and processing industries, as it specialises in the processing and freezing of species such as mackerel, herring, scad, and blue whiting. The finished processed fish is exported to markets in Africa, the Middle East and Europe by freezer ships. However, due to blanket enforcement of EU fishing regulations on Irish vessels by the Irish Department of the Marine, starting in 2005, and mackerel shoals remaining longer in Norwegian waters, there has been a downturn in the fishing industry in the town. This has led to redundancies in the fish processing industry, in which the fish factory workers have been the hardest hit.","path":[74723,-8.441315,54.63055,73373,-8.439745,54.63043,72983,-8.440665,54.63022,72744,-8.445189,54.63247,72113,-8.442944,54.63594,71873,-8.442503,54.63526,71634,-8.439112,54.63377,71454,-8.43593,54.62835,71306,-8.442014,54.61753,71153,-8.474625,54.59879,70919,-8.490909,54.62846,70673,-8.490713,54.62921,70492,-8.489945,54.62889,70342,-8.490648,54.62932,70134,-8.48831,54.62717,69954,-8.489928,54.62875,69719,-8.490666,54.62946,69503,-8.493007,54.6283,69383,-8.48998,54.62714,69203,-8.492309,54.62891,69082,-8.490037,54.6296,68873,-8.491225,54.62859,68692,-8.487045,54.63155,68392,-8.487425,54.63165,67852,-8.488317,54.63209,66951,-8.48777,54.63328,66773,-8.488095,54.63291,66591,-8.488358,54.63243,66052,-8.490797,54.63125,65901,-8.495067,54.62407,65722,-8.477137,54.59967,65601,-8.449821,54.61272,65392,-8.4373,54.62828,65211,-8.437832,54.633,65031,-8.442587,54.63579,64793,-8.442833,54.63563]},{"name":"GREEN ISLE","text":"GREEN ISLE:Green Isle may refer to a community in the United States:Green Isle is a city in Sibley County, Minnesota, United States.

During his voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures going to magical places, meeting monsters, and encountering supernatural phenomena.Origins and sources: The tales of Sinbad are a relatively late addition to the One Thousand and One Nights – they don't feature in the earliest 14th-century manuscript, and appear as an independent cycle in 17th and 18th century collections. The first known point at which they are associated with the Nights is a Turkish collection dated 1637. One of several possible etymologies of the name is Sindh and the Persian word bâd, which means wind. This would give a plausible meaning of \"India-wind\".Traceable influences include the Homeric epics (long familiar in the Arabic-speaking world, having been translated into that language as long ago as the 8th century A.D., at the court of the Caliph al-Mahdi), Pseudo-Callisthenes's \"Life of Alexander\" from the late-3rd/early 4th century A.D. via the 9th century \"Book of Animals\" of al-Jahiz, and, even earlier, in the ancient Egyptian \"Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor\". More \"recent\" sources include Abbasid works such the \"Wonders of the Created World\", reflecting the experiences of 13th century Arab mariners who braved the Indian Ocean.The Sinbad cycle is set in the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid. It first appeared in English as tale 120 in Volume 6 of Sir Richard Burton's 1885 translation of The Book of One Thousand and One Nights.Sinbad the Porter and Sinbad the Sailor. Like the 1001 Nights the Sinbad story-cycle has a frame story which goes as follows: in the days of Harun al-Rashid, Caliph of Baghdad, a poor porter (one who carries goods for others in the market and throughout the city) pauses to rest on a bench outside the gate of a rich merchant's house, where he complains to Allah about the injustice of a world which allows the rich to live in ease while he must toil and yet remain poor. The owner of the house hears and sends for the porter, finding that they are both named Sinbad. The rich Sinbad tells the poor Sinbad that he became wealthy \"by Fortune and Fate\" in the course of seven wondrous voyages, which he then proceeds to relate.","path":[69646,-8.439551,54.63076,69409,-8.438437,54.63091,69259,-8.437636,54.62721,69140,-8.439335,54.62337,69019,-8.441347,54.61956,68898,-8.443883,54.61584,68778,-8.445735,54.61212,68628,-8.447623,54.60787,68479,-8.450513,54.6074,68360,-8.450802,54.60806,68240,-8.449017,54.6095,68060,-8.446075,54.61267,67878,-8.443885,54.61683,67703,-8.44135,54.62075,67489,-8.438077,54.6255,67337,-8.43658,54.62896,67160,-8.439493,54.63064,58023,-8.437449,54.63026,57574,-8.437952,54.62863,57364,-8.437464,54.62558,57213,-8.439207,54.62076,57039,-8.441448,54.61532,56883,-8.443104,54.61044,56733,-8.44454,54.60576,56552,-8.445764,54.60023,56336,-8.446544,54.59924,56094,-8.44283,54.60047,55822,-8.439776,54.60147,55670,-8.438258,54.60271,55461,-8.439339,54.60451,55340,-8.441029,54.60548,55129,-8.448997,54.60429,54892,-8.449984,54.60707,54556,-8.449306,54.60617,54435,-8.449545,54.60629,54316,-8.449148,54.60859,54106,-8.444583,54.61453,53926,-8.441308,54.61978,53776,-8.43893,54.62417,53659,-8.437333,54.62765,53530,-8.437306,54.63075,52271,-8.439518,54.63075,51012,-8.439513,54.63073,49746,-8.439593,54.63085,38742,-8.439525,54.63075,38531,-8.437223,54.62982,37446,-8.437654,54.62949,37262,-8.437576,54.62932]},{"name":"WESTWARD ISLE","text":"WESTWARD ISLE:Ducie lies 290 miles (470 km) east of Pitcairn Island and is claimed by some to be the southernmost atoll in the world at 24 degrees south latitude.[29] However, Middleton Reef is at 29 degrees south latitude, so the assertion on behalf of Ducie Island is doubtful. Ducie Island's land area is 170 acres (1 km2) and its maximum elevation, occurring on the Westward islet, is 15 feet (4.6 m).Ducie is located 620 miles (1,000 km) west of the edge of the Easter Plate. It was formed approximately 8 million years ago,[31] after Oeno Island was formed by a hotspot that later caused a magma leak generated in the Oeno lineation. The leak spread over fracture zone FZ2, which was formed by the third movement of the Pacific Plate.[32] The atoll is part of the Oeno-Henderson-Ducie-Crough seamount, speculated to be part of the southern Tuamotus.The atoll consists of four islets: Acadia, Pandora, Westward and Edwards.[33] The last three of these can be accessed on foot from Acadia at low tide.[29] The islets were named by Harald Rehder and John Randall, who visited the atoll during an expedition by the Smithsonian Institution in 1975.Acadia Islet, along the atoll's north and east rim, is larger than the other three islets combined, measuring 140 acres (57 ha. Very long and thin, the islet is largely forested and is composed of ridges of coral rubble. It is named after the Acadia, a ship that was wrecked on Ducie in 1881.Pandora Islet, in the south, is the second largest. It is composed of sand and coral rubble that borders the lagoon. It is named after HMS Pandora.Edwards Islet lies immediately to the east of Pandora Islet and has the same characteristics. It is named after Edward Edwards, captain of HMS Pandora.Westward Islet, west of Pandora Islet, is the smallest. It appears sandy from a distance, but the soil is composed of coral rubble and dead shells. Its highest point rises 15 feet (4.6 m) above average sea level. It is named after the Westward, the ship that carried the members of the National Geographic Society and the Oceanic Institute during their 1970–71 expedition.The atoll has a central lagoon, accessible by boat only by way of a channel 100 yards (91 m) wide located in the southwest, between Pandora and Westward Islets. It has a maximum depth of 52 feet (16 m) and its bottom consists of sand and coral. Whirlpools in the lagoon are common, caused by tunnels that drain the water from the lagoon into the ocean","path":[81639,-8.439303,54.63594,80340,-8.439379,54.63595,79130,-8.439285,54.63594,77671,-8.439363,54.63601,76469,-8.439241,54.63596,75120,-8.43929,54.63599,73849,-8.439235,54.63592,72510,-8.43933,54.636,71240,-8.439272,54.63597,69999,-8.439259,54.63594,68760,-8.439332,54.63586,67510,-8.439386,54.63589,66199,-8.439382,54.63589,64910,-8.439372,54.63579,63609,-8.43949,54.63589,62310,-8.439348,54.63581,62163,-8.439123,54.63569,61893,-8.438501,54.63418,61750,-8.437257,54.63258,61539,-8.436668,54.62783,61409,-8.438182,54.62473,61271,-8.440244,54.62149,61140,-8.442476,54.61849,60930,-8.44646,54.61305,60809,-8.448997,54.60997,60689,-8.452128,54.60597,60569,-8.455544,54.60227,60420,-8.460069,54.59824,60249,-8.464005,54.59508,60120,-8.463509,54.5954,59929,-8.468661,54.59433,59732,-8.474257,54.59187,59589,-8.48035,54.5905,59439,-8.485621,54.58939,59283,-8.490612,54.58811,59149,-8.492126,54.5885,58989,-8.493932,54.58831,58770,-8.49629,54.58836,58530,-8.497844,54.58972,58290,-8.498245,54.59086,58097,-8.49899,54.59018,57956,-8.49443,54.59,57750,-8.489516,54.59119,57610,-8.486123,54.59202,57480,-8.483045,54.59273,57340,-8.479776,54.59349,57209,-8.47666,54.59421,57080,-8.473612,54.59493,56939,-8.468863,54.59637,56789,-8.46584,54.59759,56591,-8.461202,54.59932,56384,-8.454765,54.60263,56219,-8.452735,54.60513,55959,-8.449445,54.6099,55810,-8.446663,54.61355,55600,-8.442313,54.61831,55450,-8.440269,54.62155,55309,-8.438258,54.62452,55160,-8.437536,54.62761,55020,-8.43769,54.62929,54621,-8.437763,54.62932,53340,-8.437763,54.62928,52071,-8.437688,54.62928,50729,-8.437662,54.62924,49380,-8.437723,54.62929,48139,-8.437715,54.62926,46891,-8.437738,54.62925,45659,-8.437743,54.62932,44340,-8.437778,54.62929,42970,-8.437721,54.62931,41670,-8.43764,54.62934,40380,-8.437701,54.62933,39121,-8.437672,54.62932,37850,-8.437735,54.62928,36619,-8.437752,54.62925,36508,-8.437313,54.62933,36309,-8.436815,54.62712,36091,-8.441869,54.61881,35950,-8.446177,54.6132,35730,-8.454706,54.60489,35590,-8.461677,54.60041,35370,-8.474985,54.59489,35190,-8.487186,54.59157,35030,-8.498114,54.58868,34870,-8.509033,54.58584,34730,-8.518998,54.58442,34570,-8.531009,54.5836,34429,-8.541536,54.58371,34249,-8.554927,54.58427,34100,-8.565984,54.58482,33980,-8.574862,54.5859,33841,-8.585076,54.58751,33710,-8.594535,54.58917,33510,-8.608963,54.59211,33350,-8.620288,54.59455,33150,-8.634595,54.5976,33009,-8.644631,54.5997,32870,-8.653925,54.60247,32670,-8.667077,54.60654,32529,-8.676476,54.60941,32379,-8.686408,54.61245,32230,-8.695613,54.61616,32020,-8.707922,54.62199,31880,-8.715955,54.62602,31730,-8.724608,54.63029,31580,-8.733555,54.63445,31440,-8.742285,54.63799,31280,-8.75262,54.64191,31119,-8.763997,54.64476,30968,-8.774583,54.64749,30750,-8.789177,54.65229,30609,-8.79847,54.65553,30469,-8.806943,54.65934]},{"name":"FAGRABERG","text":"FAGRABERG:Tast received position is 55.93423 N / 8.36782 W on Apr 23, 2017 at 15:50 UTC.\nFishing Vessel FAGRABERG (IMO: 9184641, MMSI: 231091000) is a fishing vessel built in 1999 and currently sailing under the flag of Faeroe Islands.

TEE","text":"FIONA TEE:Fiona is a feminine given name. It was invented and first used by the Scottish poet James Macpherson (1736–96), author of the Ossian poems which he claimed were translations from ancient Gaelic sources (sources which, when challenged, he never produced). The name was subsequently used as a pseudonym by William Sharp (1855–1905), who authored several romantic works under the name \"Fiona Macleod\". The name has since become popular in England, Scotland and Ireland.[The name is considered to be a Latinised form of the Gaelic word fionn, meaning \"white\", \"fair\".The name Fiona is also sometimes used as an Anglicisation of the Irish-language name Fíona, although these names are otherwise unrelated (as Fíona is derived from an element meaning \"vine\").[2] There is also a modern tendency to equate the authentic Scottish Gaelic feminine name Fionnghal with Fiona.\nThe name Fiona is rising in popularity particularly in German-speaking countries. Fiona was the 49th most popular name for baby girls born in 2008 in Germany.[4] Fiona was tied for third place in the ranking of most popular names for baby girls born in the tiny principality of Liechtenstein in 2008.[5] The name was the 347th most popular name for girls born in the United States in 2008, where it has ranked among the top 1,000 most popular names for girls since 1990 and among the top 500 since 1999.[6] The name Fiona has been particularly popular for girls of Asian or Pacific Islander descent in New York City, where Fiona ranked as the ninth most popular name for girls from those groups in 2007.","path":[45347,-8.443722,54.63278,45199,-8.437404,54.63251,45046,-8.437384,54.6245,44866,-8.442175,54.6144,44688,-8.447248,54.60455,44510,-8.454356,54.59489,44357,-8.462087,54.58736,44177,-8.471169,54.57831,44028,-8.470491,54.57024,43848,-8.46332,54.56093,43698,-8.459295,54.55278,43519,-8.45451,54.54301,43401,-8.45289,54.53631,43218,-8.450804,54.5258,43068,-8.449037,54.51717,42919,-8.447244,54.50852,42798,-8.445514,54.5015,42652,-8.44351,54.49292,42470,-8.442277,54.48224,42320,-8.441753,54.47355,42138,-8.4451,54.46488,41598,-8.445833,54.46546,40339,-8.445851,54.46547,39079,-8.445867,54.46547,37730,-8.445855,54.46546,37550,-8.444883,54.4649,37341,-8.439029,54.46463,37220,-8.428877,54.46124,37100,-8.422328,54.46144,36980,-8.415715,54.46282,36830,-8.414019,54.46295,36651,-8.423616,54.46131,36500,-8.428953,54.46053,36110,-8.432035,54.46057,35961,-8.438697,54.46155,35812,-8.444232,54.46535,35631,-8.443069,54.47143,35481,-8.442567,54.47526,35362,-8.444623,54.47579,35241,-8.446762,54.4762,35061,-8.454063,54.47834,34912,-8.447978,54.47459,34762,-8.44371,54.4698,34611,-8.445084,54.46492,33683,-8.44588,54.46545,33533,-8.446062,54.46522,33263,-8.445889,54.46546,33142,-8.446181,54.4654,32962,-8.445889,54.46547,32813,-8.446241,54.46507,31792,-8.445871,54.46546,30533,-8.445885,54.46544,29274,-8.4459,54.46544,27925,-8.445927,54.46544,26724,-8.445953,54.46543,26604,-8.444382,54.46517,26426,-8.437768,54.47419,26245,-8.437795,54.48431,26125,-8.441335,54.4908,25974,-8.446422,54.49885,25794,-8.454407,54.50784,25555,-8.465235,54.51999,25408,-8.468879,54.52804,25286,-8.470529,54.53487,25165,-8.471457,54.5418,24987,-8.472756,54.55214,24866,-8.47351,54.55914,24717,-8.474345,54.56791,24535,-8.472775,54.57827]},{"name":"MERIDIAN","text":"MERIDIAN: A (geographical) meridian (or line of longitude) is the half of an imaginary great circle on the Earth's surface, terminated by the North Pole and the South Pole, connecting points of equal longitude. The position of a point along the meridian is given by its latitude indicating how many degrees north or south of the Equator the point is. Each meridian is perpendicular to all circles of latitude. Each is also the same length, being half of a great circle on the Earth's surface and therefore measuring 20,003.93 km (12,429.9 miles).The meridian through Greenwich (inside Greenwich Park), England, called the Prime Meridian, was set at zero degrees of longitude, while other meridians were defined by the angle at the center of the earth between where it and the prime meridian cross the equator. As there are 360 degrees in a circle, the meridian on the opposite side of the earth from Greenwich, the International Date Line, forms the other half of a circle with the one through Greenwich, and is at roughly 180° longitude (with land mass and island deviations for boundary reasons). The meridians from West of Greenwich (0°) to the International Date Line (180°) define the Western Hemisphere and the meridians from East of Greenwich (0°) to the International Date Line (180°) define the Eastern Hemisphere. Most maps show the lines of longitude.The position of the prime meridian has changed a few times throughout history, mainly due to the transit observatory being built next door to the previous one (to maintain the service to shipping). Such changes had no significant practical effect. Historically, the average error in the determination of longitude was much larger than the change in position. The adoption of WGS84 (\"World Geodetic System 84\") as the positioning system has moved the geodetic prime meridian 102.478 metres east of its last astronomic position (measured at Greenwich). The position of the current geodetic prime meridian is not identified at all by any kind of sign or marking (as the older astronomic position was) in Greenwich, but can be located using a GPS receiver. The term \"meridian\" comes from the Latin meridies, meaning \"midday\"; the sun crosses a given meridian midway between the times of sunrise and sunset on that meridian. The same Latin stem gives rise to the terms a.m. (ante meridiem) and p.m. (post meridiem) used to disambiguate hours of the day when utilizing the 12-hour clock.Magnetic: The magnetic meridian is an equivalent imaginary line connecting the magnetic south and north poles and can be taken as the horizontal component of magnetic force lines along the surface of the earth.[1][dubious – discuss] Therefore, a compass needle will be parallel to the magnetic meridian. The angle between the magnetic and the true meridian is the magnetic declination, which is relevant for navigating with a compass.\n\n","path":[81542,-8.44447,54.63263,80102,-8.444467,54.63263,78847,-8.444435,54.63263,77583,-8.44445,54.63263,76143,-8.444438,54.63263,74883,-8.444455,54.63264,73623,-8.444455,54.63264,72184,-8.444451,54.63265,70743,-8.44444,54.63266,69486,-8.444458,54.63265,68225,-8.444455,54.63265,66966,-8.444453,54.63265,65705,-8.444491,54.63265,64444,-8.444484,54.63264,63184,-8.444475,54.63263,61565,-8.444471,54.63262,60304,-8.444455,54.63262,59047,-8.44444,54.63265,57785,-8.444451,54.63263,56528,-8.444448,54.63264,55265,-8.444417,54.6326,54006,-8.444407,54.6326,52747,-8.444442,54.6326,51486,-8.444425,54.63259,50226,-8.444425,54.6326,48966,-8.444408,54.6326,47707,-8.444425,54.63263,46447,-8.444407,54.63262,45187,-8.444395,54.63261,43749,-8.444357,54.63259,42368,-8.444386,54.63256,42188,-8.438916,54.63363,42068,-8.435317,54.62941,41919,-8.438498,54.62324,41769,-8.443665,54.61743,41558,-8.452742,54.61029,41380,-8.461039,54.60469,41228,-8.471051,54.60219,41079,-8.481787,54.60139,40901,-8.494882,54.60209,40750,-8.506066,54.60266,40631,-8.514771,54.60314,40481,-8.525683,54.60365,40299,-8.53897,54.60379,40149,-8.549842,54.60389,39941,-8.565075,54.60403,39760,-8.578265,54.60413,39580,-8.59127,54.60509,39400,-8.60327,54.60817,39250,-8.612285,54.61185,39041,-8.62343,54.61783,38861,-8.628288,54.62344,38715,-8.631469,54.62466,37793,-8.63135,54.62454,37613,-8.629858,54.62505,37463,-8.626775,54.62211,37283,-8.630835,54.61801,37104,-8.639793,54.61641,36953,-8.646693,54.61605,36775,-8.654565,54.61575,36625,-8.66109,54.61563,36505,-8.66625,54.61599,36324,-8.67394,54.61655,36146,-8.681535,54.61727,35936,-8.687777,54.62021,35786,-8.689894,54.62327,35664,-8.691733,54.62574,35485,-8.693169,54.62948,35276,-8.691463,54.63387,35125,-8.693965,54.63669,34945,-8.697705,54.63973,34737,-8.701511,54.64094,34586,-8.69641,54.64019,34376,-8.690812,54.63745,34168,-8.686827,54.634,34018,-8.68527,54.63141,33837,-8.691105,54.6281,33626,-8.685815,54.62097,33446,-8.675076,54.61775,33269,-8.662113,54.61782,33118,-8.651417,54.61819,32968,-8.641249,54.61843,32817,-8.631248,54.61982,32639,-8.630177,54.62451,31596,-8.631402,54.62453,31264,-8.625932,54.62105,31056,-8.61702,54.61323,30876,-8.605719,54.60843,30695,-8.592892,54.60527,30517,-8.578858,54.60492,30365,-8.566895,54.60461,30185,-8.552564,54.60424,29977,-8.53605,54.60386,29796,-8.52167,54.60359,29649,-8.509932,54.60337,29469,-8.495602,54.60292,29256,-8.480013,54.60206,29078,-8.467176,54.60339,28928,-8.458596,54.60707,28778,-8.45162,54.61159,28627,-8.445825,54.6166,28507,-8.442052,54.62076,28357,-8.437656,54.62595,28179,-8.436978,54.63152,28028,-8.442159,54.63363,27884,-8.444478,54.63255,27381,-8.444451,54.63258]},{"name":"ANN ROUSING","text":"ANN ROUSING:The page \"ANN ROUSING\" does not exist.

bohème (French pronunciation: ​[la bɔ.ɛm], Italian: [la boˈɛm]) is an opera in four acts,[N 1] composed by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, based on Scènes de la vie de bohème by Henri Murger.[1] The world premiere performance of La bohème was in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio,[2] conducted by the young Arturo Toscanini; its U.S. premiere took place the following year, 1897, in Los Angeles. Since then, La bohème has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is one of the most frequently performed operas worldwide.[3]In 1946, fifty years after the opera's premiere, Toscanini conducted a performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. This performance was eventually released on records and on compact disc. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor (see Recording history below).According to its title page, the libretto of La bohème is based on Henri Murger's novel, Scènes de la vie de bohème, a collection of vignettes portraying young bohemians living in the Latin Quarter of Paris in the 1840s. Although usually called a novel, it has no unified plot. Like the 1849 play by Murger and Théodore Barrière, the opera's libretto focuses on the relationship between Rodolfo and Mimì, ending with her death. Also like the play, the libretto combines two characters from the novel, Mimì and Francine, into a single Mimì character. Early in the composition stage Puccini was in dispute with the composer Leoncavallo, who said that he had offered Puccini a completed libretto and felt that Puccini should defer to him. Puccini responded that he had had no idea of Leoncavallo's interest and that having been working on his own version for some time, he felt that he could not oblige him by discontinuing with the opera. Leoncavallo completed his own version in which Marcello was sung by a tenor and Rodolfo by a baritone. It was unsuccessful and is now rarely performed.[4]Much of the libretto is original. The main plots of acts two and three are the librettists' invention, with only a few passing references to incidents and characters in Murger. Most of acts one and four follow the novel, piecing together episodes from various chapters. The final scenes in acts one and four—the scenes with Rodolfo and Mimì—resemble both the play and the novel. The story of their meeting closely follows chapter 18 of the novel, in which the two lovers living in the garret are not Rodolphe and Mimì at all, but rather Jacques and Francine. The story of Mimì's death in the opera draws from two different chapters in the novel, one relating Francine's death and the other relating Mimì's.[1]The published libretto includes a note from the librettists briefly discussing their adaptation. Without mentioning the play directly, they defend their conflation of Francine and Mimì into a single character: \"Chi può non confondere nel delicato profilo di una sola donna quelli di Mimì e di Francine?\" (\"Who cannot confuse in the delicate profile of one woman the personality both of Mimì and of Francine?\"). At the time, the novel was in the public domain, Murger having died without heirs, but rights to the play were still controlled by Barrière's heirs.[5]The world première performance of La bohème took place in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio[2] and was conducted by the young Arturo Toscanini. The initial response of the audience at the first performance was subdued and critical responses were polarized.[6] Despite this varied introductory response, the opera quickly became popular throughout Italy and productions were soon mounted by the following companies: The Teatro di San Carlo (14 March 1896, with Elisa Petri as Musetta and Antonio Magini-Coletti as Marcello); The Teatro Comunale di Bologna (4 November 1896, with Amelia Sedelmayer as Musetta and Umberto Beduschi as Rodolfo); The Teatro Costanzi (17 November 1896, with Maria Stuarda Savelli as Mimì, Enrico Giannini-Grifoni as Rodolfo, and Maurizio Bensaude as Marcello); La Scala (15 March 1897, with Angelica Pandolfini as Mimì, Camilla Pasini as Musetta, Fernando De Lucia as Rodolfo, and Edoardo Camera as Marcello); La Fenice (26 December 1897, with Emilia Merolla as Mimì, Maria Martelli as Musetta, Giovanni Apostolu and Franco Mannucci as Rodolfo, and Ferruccio Corradetti as Marcello); Teatro Regio di Parma (29 January 1898, with Solomiya Krushelnytska as Mimì, Lina Cassandro as Musetta, Pietro Ferrari as Rodolfo, and Pietro Giacomello as Marcello); Paris Opera (13 June 1898); and the Teatro Donizetti di Bergamo (21 August 1898, with Emilia Corsi as Mimì, Annita Barone as Musetta, Giovanni Apostolu as Rodolfo, and Giovanni Roussel as Marcello).[7][8]The first performance of La bohème outside Italy was at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 16 June 1896. The opera was given in Alexandria, Lisbon, and Moscow in early 1897. The United Kingdom premiere took place at the Theatre Royal in Manchester, on 22 April 1897, in a presentation by the Carl Rosa Opera Company supervised by Puccini.[9] This performance was given in English and starred Alice Esty as Mimì, Bessie McDonald as Musetta, Robert Cunningham as Rodolfo, and William Paull as Marcello.[9] On 2 October 1897 the same company gave the opera's first staging at the Royal Opera House in London and on 14 October 1897 in Los Angeles for the opera's United States premiere. The opera reached New York City on 16 May 1898 when it was performed at Wallack's Theatre with Giuseppe Agostini as Rodolfo.[10] The first production of the opera actually produced by the Royal Opera House itself premiered on 1 July 1899 with Nellie Melba as Mimì, Zélie de Lussan as Musetta, Fernando De Lucia as Rodolfo, and Mario Ancona as Marcello.[7]La bohème premiered in Germany at the Kroll Opera House in Berlin on 22 June 1897. The French premiere of the opera was presented by the Opéra-Comique on 13 June 1898 at the Théâtre des Nations. The production used a French translation by Paul Ferrier and starred Julia Guiraudon as Mimì, Jeanne Tiphaine as Musetta, Adolphe Maréchal as Rodolfo, and Lucien Fugère as Marcello.[7] The Czech premiere of the opera was presented by the National Theatre on 27 February 1898.La bohème continued to gain international popularity throughout the early 20th century and the Opéra-Comique alone had already presented the opera one hundred times by 1903. The Belgian premiere took place at La Monnaie on 25 October 1900 using Ferrier's French translation with Marie Thiérry as Mimì, Léon David as Rodolfo, Eugène-Charles Badiali as Marcello, sets by Pierre Devis, Armand Lynen, and Albert Dubosq, and Philippe Flon conducting. The Metropolitan Opera staged the work for the first time on 26 December 1900 with Nellie Melba as Mimì, Annita Occhiolini-Rizzini as Musetta, Albert Saléza as Rodolfo, Giuseppe Campanari as Marcello, and Luigi Mancinelli conducting.[7]The opera was first performed in Brazil at the Theatro da Paz in Belém on 21 April 1900 with the Brazilian soprano Tilde Maragliano as Mimì, Maria Cavallini as Musetta, Giuseppe Agostini as Rodolfo and Alessandro Modesti as Marcello. The conductor was Giorgio Polacco [11]The following year La bohème was presented at the Teatro Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil, on 2 July 1901 with Elvira Miotti as Mimì, Mabel Nelma as Musetta, Michele Sigaldi as Rodolfo, and Enrico De Franceschi as Marcello. Other premieres soon followed:The first production of La bohème at the Salzburg Festival did not occur until as late as July 2012. However, that festival has not shown much interest in the operas of Puccini, only ever having one production each of Tosca and Turandot in its entire history.[13]Despite the opera's popularity with audiences, Puccini has been the target of condescension by some music critics who find his music insufficiently sophisticated or difficult.[14] The composer Benjamin Britten wrote in 1951, \"[A]fter four or five performances I never wanted to hear Bohème again. In spite of its neatness, I became sickened by the cheapness and emptiness of the music.\"[15]In the four bohemians' garretMarcello is painting while Rodolfo gazes out of the window. They complain of the cold. In order to keep warm, they burn the manuscript of Rodolfo's drama. Colline, the philosopher, enters shivering and disgruntled at not having been able to pawn some books. Schaunard, the musician of the group, arrives with food, wine and cigars. He explains the source of his riches: a job with an eccentric English gentleman, who ordered him to play his violin to a parrot until it died. The others hardly listen to his tale as they set up the table to eat and drink. Schaunard interrupts, telling them that they must save the food for the days ahead: tonight they will all celebrate his good fortune by dining at Cafe Momus, and he will pay.The friends are interrupted by Benoît, the landlord, who arrives to collect the rent. They flatter him and ply him with wine. In his drunkenness, he begins to boast of his amorous adventures, but when he also reveals that he is married, they thrust him from the room—without the rent payment—in comic moral indignation. The rent money is divided for their evening out in the Quartier Latin.Marcello, Schaunard and Colline go out, but Rodolfo remains alone for a moment in order to finish an article he is writing, promising to join his friends soon. There is a knock at the door. It is a girl who lives in another room in the building. Her candle has blown out, and she has no matches; she asks Rodolfo to light it. She is briefly overcome with faintness, and Rodolfo helps her to a chair and offers her a glass of wine. She thanks him. After a few minutes, she says that she is better and must go. But as she turns to leave, she realizes that she has lost her key.Her candle goes out in the draught and Rodolfo's candle goes out too; the pair stumble in the dark. Rodolfo, eager to spend time with the girl, to whom he is already attracted, finds the key and pockets it, feigning innocence. He takes her cold hand (Che gelida manina – \"What a cold little hand\") and tells her of his life as a poet, then asks her to tell him more about her life. The girl says her name is Mimì (Sì, mi chiamano Mimì – \"Yes, they call me Mimì\"), and describes her simple life as an embroiderer. Impatiently, the waiting friends call Rodolfo. He answers and turns to see Mimì bathed in moonlight (duet, Rodolfo and Mimì: O soave fanciulla – \"Oh lovely girl\"). They realize that they have fallen in love. Rodolfo suggests remaining at home with Mimì, but she decides to accompany him to the Cafe Momus. As they leave, they sing of their newfound love.Quartier LatinA great crowd, including children, has gathered with street sellers announcing their wares (chorus: Aranci, datteri! Caldi i marroni! – \"Oranges, dates! Hot chestnuts!\"). The friends arrive; Rodolfo buys Mimì a bonnet from a vendor, while Colline buys a coat and Schaunard a horn. Parisians gossip with friends and bargain with the vendors; the children of the streets clamor to see the wares of Parpignol, the toy seller. The friends enter the Cafe Momus.As the men and Mimì dine at the cafe, Musetta, formerly Marcello's sweetheart, arrives with her rich (and elderly) government minister admirer, Alcindoro, whom she is tormenting. It is clear she has tired of him. To the delight of the Parisians and the embarrassment of her patron, she sings a risqué song (Musetta's waltz: Quando me'n vo' – \"When I go along\"), hoping to reclaim Marcello's attention. The ploy works; at the same time, Mimì recognizes that Musetta truly loves Marcello. To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to be suffering from a tight shoe and sends him to the shoemaker to get her shoe mended. Alcindoro leaves, and Musetta and Marcello fall rapturously into each other's arms.The friends are presented with their bill. Schaunard's purse has gone missing and no one else has enough money to pay. The sly Musetta has the entire bill charged to Alcindoro. The sound of a military band is heard, and the friends leave. Alcindoro returns with the repaired shoe seeking Musetta. The waiter hands him the bill and, dumbfounded, Alcindoro sinks into a chair.At the toll gate at the Barrière d'Enfer (late February)Peddlers pass through the barriers and enter the city. Mimì appears, coughing violently. She tries to find Marcello, who is currently living in a little tavern where he paints signs for the innkeeper. She tells him of her hard life with Rodolfo, who abandoned her the night before, and of Rodolfo's terrible jealousy (O buon Marcello, aiuto! – \"Oh, good Marcello, help me!\"). Marcello tells her that Rodolfo is asleep inside, and expresses concern about Mimì's cough. Rodolfo wakes up and comes out looking for Marcello. Mimì hides and overhears Rodolfo first telling Marcello that he left Mimì because of her coquettishness, but finally confessing that his jealousy is a sham: he fears she is slowly being consumed by a deadly illness (most likely tuberculosis, known by the catchall name \"consumption\" in the nineteenth century). Rodolfo, in his poverty, can do little to help Mimì and hopes that his pretended unkindness will inspire her to seek another, wealthier suitor (Marcello, finalmente – \"Marcello, finally\").Out of kindness towards Mimì, Marcello tries to silence him, but she has already heard all. Her weeping and coughing reveal her presence, and Rodolfo hurries to her. Musetta's laughter is heard and Marcello goes to find out what has happened. Mimì tells Rodolfo that she is leaving him, and asks that they separate amicably (Mimì: Donde lieta uscì – \"From here she happily left\"); but their love for one another is too strong for the pair to part. As a compromise, they agree to remain together until the spring, when the world is coming to life again and no one feels truly alone. Meanwhile, Marcello has found Musetta, and the couple quarrel fiercely about Musetta's flirtatiousness: an antithetical counterpoint to the other pair's reconciliation (quartet: Mimì, Rodolfo, Musetta, Marcello: Addio dolce svegliare alla mattina! – \"Goodbye, sweet awakening in the morning!\").Back in the garret (some months later)Marcello and Rodolfo are trying to work, though they are primarily talking about their girlfriends, who have left them and found wealthy lovers. Rodolfo has seen Musetta in a fine carriage and Marcello has seen Mimì dressed like a queen. The men both express their nostalgia (duet: O Mimì, tu più non torni – \"O Mimì, will you not return?\"). Schaunard and Colline arrive with a very frugal dinner and all parody eating a plentiful banquet, dance together and sing, before Schaunard and Colline engage in a mock duel.Musetta suddenly appears; Mimì, who took up with a wealthy viscount after leaving Rodolfo in the spring, has left her patron. Musetta found her that day in the street, severely weakened by her illness, and Mimì begged Musetta to bring her to Rodolfo. Mimì, haggard and pale, is assisted onto a bed. Briefly, she feels as though she is recovering. Musetta and Marcello leave to sell Musetta's earrings in order to buy medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his overcoat (Vecchia zimarra – \"Old coat\"). Schaunard leaves with Colline to give Mimì and Rodolfo some time together. Mimì tells Rodolfo that her love for him is her whole life (aria/duet, Mimì and Rodolfo: Sono andati? – \"Have they gone?\").To Mimì's delight, Rodolfo presents her with the pink bonnet he bought her, which he has kept as a souvenir of their love. They remember past happiness and their first meeting—the candles, the lost key. Suddenly, Mimì is overwhelmed by a coughing fit. The others return, with a gift of a muff to warm Mimì's hands and some medicine. Mimì gently thanks Rodolfo for the muff, which she believes is a present from him, reassures him that she is better and falls asleep. Musetta prays. Schaunard discovers that Mimì has died. Rodolfo rushes to the bed, calling Mimì's name in anguish, weeping helplessly as the curtain falls.La bohème is scored for:The discography of La bohème is a long one with many distinguished recordings, including the 1972 Decca recording conducted by Herbert von Karajan with Luciano Pavarotti as Rodolfo and Mirella Freni as Mimì (made before Pavarotti became an international superstar of opera),[17] and the 1973 RCA Victor recording conducted by Sir Georg Solti with Montserrat Caballé as Mimì and Plácido Domingo as Rodolfo which won the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording. The earliest commercially released full-length recording was probably that recorded in February 1917 and released on HMV's Italian label La Voce del Padrone.[18] Carlo Sabajno conducted the La Scala Orchestra and Chorus with Gemma Bosini and Reno Andreini as Mimì and Rodolfo. One of the most recent is the 2008 Deutsche Grammophon release conducted by Bertrand de Billy with Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón as Mimì and Rodolfo.[17]There are several recordings with conductors closely associated with Puccini. In the 1946 RCA Victor recording, Arturo Toscanini, who conducted the world premiere of the opera, conducts the NBC Symphony Orchestra with Jan Peerce as Rodolfo and Licia Albanese as Mimì. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor. Thomas Beecham, who worked closely with Puccini when preparing a 1920 production of La bohème in London,[19] conducted a performance of the opera in English released by Columbia Records in 1936 with Lisa Perli as Mimì and Heddle Nash as Rodolfo. Beecham also conducts on the 1956 RCA Victor recording with Victoria de los Ángeles and Jussi Björling as Mimì and Rodolfo.Although the vast majority of recordings are in the original Italian, the opera has been recorded in several other languages. These include: a recording in French conducted by Erasmo Ghiglia with Renée Doria and Alain Vanzo as Mimì and Rodolfo (1960);[20] a recording in German with Richard Kraus conducting the Deutsche Oper Berlin Orchestra and Chorus with Trude Eipperle and Fritz Wunderlich as Mimì and Rodolfo (1956); and the 1998 release on the Chandos Opera in English label with David Parry conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra and Cynthia Haymon and Dennis O'Neill as Mimì and Rodolfo.Enrico Caruso, who was closely associated with the role of Rodolfo, recorded the famous aria \"Che gelida manina\" in 1906. This aria has been recorded by nearly 500 tenors in at least seven different languages between 1900 and 1980.[21] In 1981 the A.N.N.A. Record Company released a six LP set with 101 different tenors singing the aria.In 1957 Illica’s widow died and his papers were given to the Parma Museum. Among them was the full libretto to La bohème. It was discovered that the librettists had prepared an act which Puccini decided not to use in his composition.[22] It is noteworthy for explaining Rodolfo’s jealous remarks to Marcello in act 3.The \"missing act\" is located in the timeline between the Café Momus scene and act 3 and describes an open-air party at Musetta's dwelling. Her protector has refused to pay further rent out of jealous feelings, and Musetta's furniture is moved into the courtyard to be auctioned off the following morning. The four Bohemians find in this an excuse for a party and arrange for wine and an orchestra. Musetta gives Mimì a beautiful gown to wear and introduces her to a Viscount. The pair dances a quadrille in the courtyard, which moves Rodolfo to jealousy. This explains his act 3 reference to the \"moscardino di Viscontino\" (young fop of a Viscount). As dawn approaches, furniture dealers gradually remove pieces for the morning auction.In 1959 \"Musetta's Waltz\" was adapted by songwriter Bobby Worth for the pop song \"Don't You Know?\", a hit for Della Reese.[23] Earlier, it was used for another song, \"One Night of Love\"[4]In 1969 in Paris, American free-jazz pianist Dave Burrell recorded his La Vie de Bohème with a seven-piece group of European and American musicians. The music on the double-LP is improvised and experimental, but the listener can still discern Puccini's themes, as well as the narrative arc of the complete opera.[24]Rent, a 1996 musical by Jonathan Larson, is based on La bohème. Here the lovers, Roger and Mimi, are faced with AIDS and progress through the action with songs such as \"Light My Candle\", which have direct reference to La bohème.[25] Many of the character names are retained or are similar (e.g. the character Angel is given the surname \"Schunard\"), and at another point in the play, Roger's roommate and best friend Mark makes a wry reference to \"Musetta's Waltz\", which is a recurring theme throughout the first act and is played at the end of the second act.The opera was also adapted into a 1983 short story form by the novelist V. S. Pritchett for publication by the Metropolitan Opera Association.[26] La Bohème: Una piccola storia sull'immortalità dell'amore e dell'amicizia by Carollina Fabinger is an illustrated version in Italian for young readers published by Nuages, Milan, 2009. A short parody, The One-Minute, Non-Musical La Boheme for One or More Actors, by Meron Langsner was published by McSweeney's Internet Tendency in 2012.[27]Baz Luhrmann produced the opera for Opera Australia in 1990[28] with modernized supertitle translations, and a budget of only A$60,000. A DVD was issued of the stage show. According to Luhrmann, this version was set in 1957 (rather than the original period of 1830) because \"...[they] discovered that 1957 was a very, very accurate match for the social and economic realities of Paris in the 1840s.\"[28] In 2002, Luhrmann restaged his version on Broadway, the production won two Tony Awards out of six nominations; for Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design as well as a special award, the Tony Honor for Excellence in Theatre.[29][30] To play the eight performances per week on Broadway, three casts of Mimìs and Rodolfos, and two Musettas and Marcellos, were used in rotation.[31]Robin Norton-Hale directed a new production produced by Adam Spreadbury-Maher at the Cock Tavern Theatre, Kilburn, for OperaUpClose in December 2009.[32] Originally planned for a six-week season, it was extended for five months. The production was set in present-day North London, specifically in the Kilburn area, which is described as one \"of pound shops and betting shops, casual labour and cheap sublets. A nice verismo touch, this – it also has the highest rate of tuberculosis infection in Greater London.”[33] Although acts 1, 3 and 4 of this production took place in the pub's tiny upstairs theatre, for act 2 the entire audience and cast moved downstairs to the pub itself, with the pub's patrons serving as extras in the Cafe Momus scene.

The name Robert is a Germanic given name, from Old High German Hruodberht \"bright with glory\" (a compound of hruod \"fame, glory\" and berht \"bright\").

Goddess of chance, luck and fate  Fortuna governs the circle of the four stages of life, the Wheel of Fortune, in a manuscript of Carmina Burana  Abode Rome Symbol Globe, Cornucopia, Wheel, Wreath Greek equivalent Tyche Fortuna (Latin: Fortūna, equivalent to the Greek goddess Tyche) was the goddess of fortune and personification of luck in Roman religion. She might bring good luck or bad: she could be represented as veiled and blind, as in modern depictions of Justice, and came to represent life's capriciousness. She was also a goddess of fate: as Atrox Fortuna, she claimed the young lives of the princeps Augustus' grandsons Gaius and Lucius, prospective heirs to the Empire.[1] Her father was said to be Jupiter and like him, she could also be bountiful (Copia). As Annonaria she protected grain supplies. June 11 was sacred to her: on June 24 she was given cult at the festival of Fors Fortuna.[2][3]    Contents  1 Cult 2 Middle Ages 3 Pars Fortuna in astrology 4 Aspects of Fortuna 5 See also 6 Notes 7 References 8 External links   Cult[edit]     Fortuna and Pontos   Fortuna's Roman cult was variously attributed to Servius Tullius – whose exceptional good fortune suggested their sexual intimacy[4] – and to Ancus Marcius.[5] The two earliest temples mentioned in Roman Calendars were outside the city, on the right bank of the Tiber (in Italian Trastevere). The first temple dedicated to Fortuna was attributed to the Etruscan Servius Tullius, while the second is known to have been built in 293 BC as the fulfilment of a Roman promise made during later Etruscan wars[6] The date of dedication of her temples was 24 June, or Midsummer’s Day, when celebrants from Rome annually floated to the temples downstream from the city. After undisclosed rituals they then rowed back, garlanded and inebriated.[7] Also Fortuna had a temple at the Forum Boarium. Here Fortuna was twinned with the cult of Mater Matuta (the goddesses shared a festival on 11 June), and the paired temples have been revealed in the excavation beside the church of Sant'Omobono: the cults are indeed archaic in date.[8] Fortuna Primigenia of Praeneste was adopted by Romans at the end of 3rd BC in an important cult of Fortuna Publica Populi Romani (the Official Good Luck of the Roman People) on the Quirinalis outside the Porta Collina.[9] No temple at Rome, however, rivalled the magnificence of the Praenestine sanctuary. Fortuna's identity as personification of chance events was closely tied to virtus (strength of character). Public officials who lacked virtues invited ill-fortune on themselves and Rome: Sallust uses the infamous Catiline as illustration – \"Truly, when in the place of work, idleness, in place of the spirit of measure and equity, caprice and pride invade, fortune is changed just as with morality\".[10] An oracle at the Temple of Fortuna Primigena in Praeneste used a form of divination in which a small boy picked out one of various futures that were written on oak rods. Cults to Fortuna in her many forms are attested throughout the Roman world. Dedications have been found to Fortuna Dubia (doubtful fortune), Fortuna Brevis (fickle or wayward fortune) and Fortuna Mala (bad fortune). She is found in a variety of domestic and personal contexts. During the early Empire, an amulet from the House of Menander in Pompeii links her to the Egyptian goddess Isis, as Isis-Fortuna.[11] She is functionally related to the God Bonus Eventus,[12] who is often represented as her counterpart: both appear on amulets and intaglio engraved gems across the Roman world.     Vatican, Rome, Italy. Statue of Fortune. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection   Her name seems to derive from Vortumna (she who revolves the year).[citation needed] The earliest reference to the Wheel of Fortune, emblematic of the endless changes in life between prosperity and disaster, is from 55 BC.[13] In Seneca's tragedy Agamemnon, a chorus addresses Fortuna in terms that would remain almost proverbial, and in a high heroic ranting mode that Renaissance writers would emulate:  \"O Fortune, who dost bestow the throne’s high boon with mocking hand, in dangerous and doubtful state thou settest the too exalted. Never have sceptres obtained calm peace or certain tenure; care on care weighs them down, and ever do fresh storms vex their souls. ...great kingdoms sink of their own weight, and Fortune gives way ‘neath the burden of herself. Sails swollen with favouring breezes fear blasts too strongly theirs; the tower which rears its head to the very clouds is beaten by rainy Auster.... Whatever Fortune has raised on high, she lifts but to bring low. Modest estate has longer life; then happy he whoe’er, content with the common lot, with safe breeze hugs the shore, and, fearing to trust his skiff to the wider sea, with unambitious oar keeps close to land.\"[14]  Ovid's description is typical of Roman representations: in a letter from exile[15] he reflects ruefully on the \"goddess who admits by her unsteady wheel her own fickleness; she always has its apex beneath her swaying foot.\" Middle Ages[edit]     The humiliation of Emperor Valerian by king Shapur I of Persia (260) passed into European cultural memory as an instance of the reversals of Fortuna. In Hans Holbein's pen-and-ink drawing (1521), the universal lesson is brought home by its contemporary setting.   Fortuna did not disappear from the popular imagination with the ascendancy of Christianity by any means.[16]Saint Augustine took a stand against her continuing presence, in the City of God: \"How, therefore, is she good, who without discernment comes to both the good and to the bad? ...It profits one nothing to worship her if she is truly fortune... let the bad worship her...this supposed deity\".[17] In the 6th century, the Consolation of Philosophy, by statesman and philosopher Boethius, written while he faced execution, reflected the Christian theology of casus, that the apparently random and often ruinous turns of Fortune's Wheel are in fact both inevitable and providential, that even the most coincidental events are part of God's hidden plan which one should not resist or try to change. Fortuna, then, was a servant of God,[18] and events, individual decisions, the influence of the stars were all merely vehicles of Divine Will. In succeeding generations Boethius' Consolation was required reading for scholars and students. Fortune crept back into popular acceptance, with a new iconographic trait, \"two-faced Fortune\", Fortuna bifrons; such depictions continue into the 15th century.[19]     Albrecht Dürer's engraving of Fortuna, ca 1502   The ubiquitous image of the Wheel of Fortune found throughout the Middle Ages and beyond was a direct legacy of the second book of Boethius's Consolation. The Wheel appears in many renditions from tiny miniatures in manuscripts to huge stained glass windows in cathedrals, such as at Amiens. Lady Fortune is usually represented as larger than life to underscore her importance. The wheel characteristically has four shelves, or stages of life, with four human figures, usually labeled on the left regnabo (I shall reign), on the top regno (I reign) and is usually crowned, descending on the right regnavi (I have reigned) and the lowly figure on the bottom is marked sum sine regno (I have no kingdom). Medieval representations of Fortune emphasize her duality and instability, such as two faces side by side like Janus; one face smiling the other frowning; half the face white the other black; she may be blindfolded but without scales, blind to justice. She was associated with the cornucopia, ship's rudder, the ball and the wheel. The cornucopia is where plenty flows from, the Helmsman's rudder steers fate, the globe symbolizes chance (who gets good or bad luck), and the wheel symbolizes that luck, good or bad, never lasts.     Fortuna lightly balances the orb of sovereignty between thumb and finger in a Dutch painting of ca 1530 (Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg)   Fortune would have many influences in cultural works throughout the Middle Ages. In Le Roman de la Rose, Fortune frustrates the hopes of a lover who has been helped by a personified character \"Reason\". In Dante's Inferno (vii.67-96) Virgil explains the nature of Fortune, both a devil and a ministering angel, subservient to God. Boccaccio's De Casibus Virorum Illustrium (\"The Fortunes of Famous Men\"), used by John Lydgate to compose his Fall of Princes, tells of many where the turn of Fortune's wheel brought those most high to disaster, and Boccaccio essay De remedii dell'una e dell'altra Fortuna, depends upon Boethius for the double nature of Fortuna. Fortune makes her appearance in Carmina Burana (see image). The Christianized Lady Fortune is not autonomous: illustrations for Boccaccio's Remedii show Fortuna enthroned in a triumphal car with reins that lead to heaven,[20] and appears in chapter 25 of Machiavelli's The Prince, in which he says Fortune only rules one half of men's fate, the other half being of their own will. Machiavelli reminds the reader that Fortune is a woman, that she favours a strong, or even violent hand, and that she favours the more aggressive and bold young man than a timid elder. Even Shakespeare was no stranger to Lady Fortune: When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes I all alone beweep my outcast state ... — Sonnet 29 Pars Fortuna in astrology[edit]     llustration by Al-Biruni (973-1048) of different phases of the moon, from the Persian Kitab al-tafhim   In astrology the term ‘Pars Fortuna’ represents a mathematical point in the zodiac derived by the longitudinal positions of the Sun, Moon and Ascendant (Rising sign) in the birth chart of an individual. It represents an especially beneficial point in the horoscopic chart. In Arabic Astrology, this point is called Arabian Parts.[21] The procedure followed for fixing one’s Pars Fortuna in ancient and traditional astrology depended on the time of birth, viz., during daylight or night time (whether the Sun was above or below the horizon). In modern western astrology the day time formula only was used for many years, but with more knowledge of ancient astrology, the two calculation methods are now often used. The formula for calculating the day time Part of Fortune (PF) is (using the 360 degree positions for each point): PF = Ascendant + Moon - Sun The formula for the night-time Part of Fortune is PF = Ascendant + Sun - Moon Each calculation method results in a different zodiac position for the Part of Fortune.[22] Al Biruni (973 – 1048), an 11th-century mathematician, astronomer and scholar, who was the greatest proponent of this system of prediction, listed a total of 97 Arabic Parts, which were widely used for astrological consultations. Paul Vachier has prepared an Arabic Parts Calculator for all the Arabic Parts.[23] Aspects of Fortuna[edit]     Lady Fortune in a Boccaccio manuscript   Fortuna Annonaria brought the luck of the harvest Fortuna Belli the fortune of war Fortuna Primigenia directed the fortune of a firstborn child at the moment of birth Fortuna Virilis, \"Manly Fortune,\" was celebrated only by women Fortuna Redux brought one safely home Fortuna Respiciens the fortune of the provider Fortuna Muliebris the luck of a woman. Typical of Roman attitudes, the fortune of a woman in marriage, however, was Fortuna Virilis.[citation needed] Fortuna Victrix brought victory in battle Fortuna Augusta the fortune of the emperor[24] Fortuna Balnearis the fortune of the baths.[24] Fortuna Conservatrix the fortune of the Preserver[25] Fortuna Equestris fortune of the Knights.[25] Fortuna Huiusce Diei fortune of the present day.[25] Fortuna Obsequens fortune of indulgence.[25] Fortuna Privata fortune of the private individual.[25] Fortuna Publica fortune of the people.[25] Fortuna Romana fortune of Rome.[25] Fortuna Virgo fortune of the virgin.[25] Pars Fortuna See also[edit] Carmina Burana (Orff) (opening theme: \"O Fortuna\") Column of the Goths Fortune favours the bold (Fortes fortuna adiuvat) Notes[edit]  ^ Marguerite Kretschmer, \"Atrox Fortuna\" The Classical Journal 22.4 (January 1927), 267 - 275. ^ Samuel Ball Platner and Thomas Ashby, A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome,; (London: Oxford University Press) 1929: on-line text. ^ Ovid, Fasti VI. 773‑786. ^ Varro, De Lingua Latina VI.17. ^ Plutarch; see Samuel Ball Platner and Thomas Ashby, A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome,; (London: Oxford University Press) 1929: on-line text. ^ Livy, 'Ad Urbem Condita', 2.40. ^ Billington, S., Green, M.

Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), also known as the steinbock or bouquetin, is a species of wild goat that lives in the mountains of the European Alps. It is a sexually dimorphic species with larger males who carry larger, curved horns. The coat colour is typically brownish grey. Alpine ibex tend to live in steep, rough terrain above the snow line. They are also social, although adult males and females segregate for most of the year, coming together only to mate. Four distinct groups exist; adult male groups, female-offsping groups, groups of young individuals, and mixed sex groups. During the breeding season, males fight for access to females and use their long horns in agonistic behaviours. After being extirpated from most areas by the 19th century, the Alpine ibex was reintroduced to parts of its historical range and all individuals living today descend from the stock in Gran Paradiso National Park in northwest Italy and from the neighbouring French valley of Maurienne,[2] now part of the Vanoise National Park linked to the former. These two national parks are connected and have been especially created to help the ibex to thrive. The ibex is the emblem of the Gran Paradiso National Park and of the Vanoise national park. The species is currently listed as of least concern by the IUCN.

It is classified in the genus Capra (Latin for \"goat\") with at least seven other species of wild goat. Both Capra and Ovis (sheep) descended from a goral-like animal from the Miocene and early Pliocene, whose fossils are found in Kenya, China and Slovenia. The genus Tossunnoria appears in China during the late Miocene and appears to have been intermediate between gorals and goats. Fossils of Alpine ibex date back to the late Pleistocene, when it and the Spanish ibex probably evolved from the extinct Pleistocene species Capra camburgensis.[3] The Nubian (C. nubiana), Walia (C. walie) and Siberian ibex (C. sibirica) are sometimes considered to be subspecies of the Alpine ibex, giving populations in the Alps the trinomial of C. i. ibex.[4] Appearance[edit]       Video of a herd of Alpine ibex on Augstmatthorn in the Bernese Highlands, Switzerland   Compared with other members of its genus, the Alpine ibex has a short, broad head and a duller coat. It has brownish grey hair over most of the body, a pale abdomen and slightly darker markings on the chin and throat and in a stripe along the back. They moult twice a year, firstly in April or May, and then again in September, when they replace the short summer coat with thicker hair and a woolly undercoat. As with all goats, males have beards, while females do not.[3] Males commonly grow to a height of 90 to 101 centimetres (35 to 40 in) at the withers, with a body length of 149 to 171 centimetres (59 to 67 in) and weigh from 67 to 117 kilograms (148 to 258 lb). Females are noticeably smaller, with a shoulder height of 73 to 84 centimetres (29 to 33 in), a body length of 121 to 141 centimetres (48 to 56 in), and a weight of 17 to 32 kilograms (37 to 71 lb). Both male and female Alpine ibexes have large, backwards-curving, horns with numerous ridges along their length. At 69 to 98 centimetres (27 to 39 in), those of the males are substantially larger than those of females, which reach only 18 to 35 centimetres (7.1 to 13.8 in) in length.[3] Distribution and ecology[edit]     Ibex standing on cliff in winter.   The Alpine ibex was, at one point, restricted only to the Gran Paradiso National Park in northern Italy, and in the Maurienne Valley in the French Alps [5] but in recent years it was both reintroduced to and recolonised most of the European Alps, and is also found in most of all the French alpine ranges, southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria. It was also introduced to Bulgaria and Slovenia.[1] An excellent climber, its preferred habitat is the rocky region along the snow line above alpine forests, where it occupies steep, rough terrain at elevations of 1,800 to 3,300 metres (5,900 to 10,800 ft).[6] Alpine ibex are typically absent from woodland areas[3] although adult males in densely populated areas may stay in larch and mixed larch-spruce woodland if there is no snow.[7] In Hochlantsch, males spend winter in coniferous forests.[3] For most of the year, males and females occupy different habitat.[8] Females rely on steep terrain more so than males.[9] Males use lowland meadows during the spring, which is when snow melts and green grass appears.[9] They then climb to alpine meadows during the summer.[7] When winter arrives, both sexes move to steep rocky slopes that amass little snow.[10] They prefer slopes of 30–45° and use small caves and overhangs for shelter.[11] Home ranges are highly variable, depending on the availability of resources, and vary in size throughout the year. Figures of anything from 180 to 2,800 hectares (0.69 to 10.81 sq mi; 1.8 to 28.0 km2) have been recorded.[3][10] Home ranges tend to be largest during summer and autumn, smallest in winter and intermediate in spring.[3] Female home ranges are usually smaller than those of males. Alpine ibexes appear to have a low rate of predation and typically die of age, starvation or disease in Gran Paradiso.[3] Foraging[edit]     Adult male Ibex in Savoy   Alpine ibexes are strictly herbivorous, with over half of their diet consisting of grasses, and the remainder being a mixture of moss, flowers, leaves, and twigs.[3] If leaves and shoots are out of reach, they often stand on their rear legs to reach this food. Grass genera that are the most commonly eaten are Agrostis, Avena, Calamagrostis, Festuca, Phleum, Poa, Sesleria and Trisetum.[3] The climbing ability of the Alpine ibex is such that it has been observed standing on the sheer face of a dam, where it licks the stonework to obtain mineral salts.[12] Life history[edit]     Young ibex at play   Although the Alpine ibex is a social species, they segregate sexually and spatially depending on the season.[9] Four types of groups exist. Adult male groups, female-offsping groups, groups of young individuals 2–3 years old, and mixed sex groups.[3][13] Young groups are numerous at the beginning of summer but are expelled by females at the end of their gestation period. Female and offspring groups occur year-round, at least in an area of the French Alps.[13] Mixed sex groups of adult males and females occur during breeding, which lasts from December to January. By April and May, the adults separate.[13] The largest aggregations of either sex occur during June and July. Gatherings of males begin to decrease during October and November, and are lowest from the rut from December to March.[13] The males then leave their separate wintering areas and gather again.[14]     Male ibex locking horns   There is a linear dominance hierarchy among males. In small populations, which are more cohesive, male ibex know their place in the hierarchy based on memories of past encounters[3] while in mobile and large groups, where encounters with strangers are common, rank is based on horn size.[15] Antagonistic behavior in males can come in the form of \"direct\" or \"indirect\" aggression. With direct aggression, one male bumps another with its horns or places itself front of its opponent. It stands on its hind legs and comes down on his opponent with its horns. This may signal that it is ready to clash or it may be attempting a real clash.[3] Indirect aggression is mostly intimidation displays.[3]     Mother with young   Reproduction and growth[edit] The breeding season starts in December, and typically lasts around six weeks. During this time, male herds break up into smaller groups that search for females. The rut takes place in two phases. In the first phase, the male groups interact with the females who are all in oestrous. The higher the male's rank, the closer he can get to a female.[3] Males perform courtship displays. In the second phase of the rut, one male separates from his group to follow an individual female. He displays to her and guards her from other males. Before copulation, the female moves her tail and courtship becomes more intensive. They copulate and then he rejoins his group and reverts to the first phase.[3] Gestation lasts around 167 days, and results in the birth of one or two kids, with twins making up about 20% of births.[16] Alpine ibex reach sexual maturity at eighteen months, but females do not reach their maximum body size for five to six years, and males not for nine to eleven years. The horns grow throughout life, growing most rapidly during the second year of life, and thereafter by about 8 centimetres (3.1 in) a year, eventually slowing to half that rate once the animal reaches ten years of age. Alpine ibex live for up to nineteen years in the wild[17] Conservation status[edit]     Young Alpine ibex on a cliff   The Alpine ibex historically ranged through France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Bavaria, Austria and Slovenia. Starting in the early 1500s the overall population declined due to overexploitation and poaching and the ibex became extinct in Switzerland and Germany by the 18th century. Ibexes were extinct in Austria and northeastern Italy by the 19th century. They remained only in and around the Gran Paradiso and Vanoise Massif. Located in the western Italian Alps and the Maurienne valley in the eastern north French alps, bordering the Vanoise and Gran Paradiso Massif, the park was declared a royal hunting reserve in 1854 by Vittorio Emanuele II.[18] Ibex were protected from poaching and their numbers increased, reaching 3,020 in 1914. The ibex enjoyed further protection when Gran Paradiso was made into a national park in 1922. Animals from this stock both drifted naturally and were introduced to other areas. By 1976, the number of populations of ibex numbered 104. Today, the total population of Alpine ibex is over 20,000[18] and is considered to be of Least Concern by the IUCN.[1] However, introduced populations of ibex appear to have low genetic diversity.[19] References[edit]  ^ a b c Aulagnier, S., Kranz, A., Lovari, S., Jdeidi, T., Masseti, M., Nader, I., de Smet, K. & Cuzin, F.

Wasser is a village in southwest Germany, in the Upper Rhine Valley, located at the Elz River. In June 2005, Wasser had 1717 inhabitants. In the mid-1970s it was part incorporated into the city of Emmendingen.\nThe Breites Wasser is a lake in the borough of Osterholz-Scharmbeck in the German state of Lower Saxony on the terrain of the Teufelsmoor. A nature reserve of the same name lies around the lake between Worpswede and the village of Teufelsmoor. The lake is situated at the confluence of the Beek and the Hamme about 2 km downstream of Beek. The many ox-bows of the streams and small irregular ponds with boggy shores, the so-called Blänken form a wetland triangle (feuchtes Dreieck), which constantly changes its appearance due to the variations in water levels. Many rare birds breed in the area and there are also colonies of gulls. In autumn and spring quite a few migratory birds rest here en route to their destinations.Several years ago a large number of paths were laid out for walkers","path":[85140,9.876427,53.53722,83820,9.876425,53.5372,82380,9.87642,53.53721,80940,9.876418,53.53721,79500,9.876418,53.5372,78060,9.876416,53.53721,76620,9.876425,53.53721,75180,9.87642,53.53721,73740,9.876423,53.53723,72360,9.876407,53.53721,71040,9.87643,53.53721,70860,9.87643,53.53721,69540,9.87641,53.53721,68340,9.876415,53.53721,66900,9.876442,53.53721,65640,9.876433,53.53721,64440,9.876413,53.53721,63240,9.8764,53.53723,62040,9.8764,53.53722,61920,9.87643,53.53721,61560,9.876418,53.5372,60360,9.876405,53.53721,59160,9.876415,53.53721,57780,9.87642,53.53721,56340,9.876431,53.5372,54900,9.876422,53.53721,53700,9.87641,53.53721,52500,9.876425,53.53721,51300,9.876429,53.53721,50100,9.876418,53.5372,48900,9.876405,53.53721,47700,9.876404,53.53719,46500,9.87641,53.53722,45300,9.87642,53.53722,43920,9.876422,53.53721,43800,9.87634,53.53723,43680,9.87616,53.53732,43500,9.876585,53.54151,43320,9.891176,53.5423,43140,9.906397,53.54225,42960,9.921655,53.54238,42780,9.936399,53.5421,42600,9.950804,53.54325,42420,9.965357,53.54448,42240,9.978895,53.54131,42060,9.989997,53.53631,41820,10.00101,53.52912,41640,10.00484,53.52507,40560,10.00485,53.52506,39120,10.00483,53.52507,37680,10.00484,53.52506,36420,10.00458,53.52515,36180,10.00869,53.5246,35220,10.00885,53.52479,33900,10.00885,53.52478,32460,10.00884,53.52478,31020,10.00885,53.52477,30780,10.0065,53.52635,30600,10.00047,53.52905,30480,9.995678,53.53176,30300,9.987072,53.53753,30120,9.976869,53.54082,29940,9.966639,53.54309,29760,9.955423,53.54298,29520,9.941274,53.54101,29340,9.929883,53.54119,29160,9.918857,53.54062,28980,9.907647,53.54049,28800,9.895565,53.54081,28560,9.882894,53.54089,28380,9.881184,53.53661,28200,9.889725,53.53154,28020,9.891731,53.52402,27900,9.890315,53.52021,27180,9.88931,53.52008,25860,9.889297,53.52009,24660,9.889312,53.52008,24540,9.889657,53.51991,24420,9.89144,53.52091,24240,9.890767,53.52719,24060,9.886026,53.53328,23880,9.877838,53.53794,23700,9.867782,53.54273,23520,9.853205,53.54502,23280,9.838152,53.54733,23100,9.824592,53.54957,22920,9.809669,53.55238,22740,9.794483,53.55527,22500,9.77918,53.55771,22320,9.765113,53.55938,22140,9.750928,53.56068,21960,9.746701,53.56275,21840,9.748754,53.56254,21720,9.751935,53.56216,21540,9.738379,53.56146,20700,9.738207,53.56167,19380,9.73812,53.5612,19200,9.738579,53.56135,18960,9.742851,53.56076,18780,9.753812,53.56069,18600,9.763548,53.56126,18420,9.773295,53.56059,18240,9.784059,53.55898,18060,9.794039,53.55714,17880,9.804222,53.55537,17700,9.814533,53.55357,17520,9.82484,53.55173,17340,9.83531,53.54977,17160,9.84556,53.54819,16980,9.855795,53.54654,16800,9.865693,53.54479,16620,9.874102,53.54051,16440,9.876404,53.53721,15060,9.876418,53.53721,13740,9.876405,53.53721,13500,9.876409,53.53722,12120,9.876402,53.5372,10920,9.8764,53.5372,9600,9.876413,53.53721,8160,9.876402,53.53722,6720,9.876413,53.53721,5340,9.876413,53.53721,3900,9.8764,53.5372,2580,9.876407,53.5372,1200,9.876415,53.53721]},{"name":"FAIRPLAY VI","text":"Sold in 1946 to Fairplay Towing & Shipping Co Ltd, London and  ... later that year and converted to a missionary ship and renamed John Williams VI.  ...  46 KB (7,139 words) - 18:20, 13 May 2014 Right to counsel    An innate sense of fair-play prevailed therefore, permitting defence ...

For the three-wheeler, see Tempo (car).     Reliefs of coats of arms of the three Hanseatic cities (sisters)       Johann Hinrich Gossler of the Hanseatic Berenberg-Gossler-Seyler banking dynasty, who married Elisabeth Berenberg and became owner of Berenberg Bank   The Hanseaten (English: Hanseatics) is a collective term for the hierarchy group (so called First Families) consisting of elite individuals and families of prestigious rank who constituted the ruling class of the free imperial city of Hamburg, conjointly with the equal First Families of the free imperial cities Bremen and Lübeck. The members of these First Families were the persons in possession of hereditary grand burghership (German: Großbürgerschaft) of these cities, including the mayors (Bürgermeister), the senators (Senatoren) and the senior pastors (Hauptpastoren). Hanseaten refers specifically to the ruling families of Hamburg, Lübeck and Bremen, but more broadly, this group is also referred to as patricians along with similar social groups elsewhere in continental Europe. The three cities since the Congress of Vienna 1815 are each officially named the \"Free and Hanseatic City Hamburg\" (Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg),[1][2] the \"Free Hanseatic City Bremen\" (Freie Hansestadt Bremen) and the \"Free and Hanseatic City Lübeck\" (Freie und Hansestadt Lübeck), since 1937 merely the \"Hanseatic City Lübeck\" (Hansestadt Lübeck).[3] Hamburg was one of the oldest stringent civic republics,[4] in which the Hanseatics preserved their constitutional privileges granted in 1189 by Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor until the German Revolution of 1918–19 and the Weimar Constitution.[5] Hamburg was strictly republican, but it was not a democracy, but rather an oligarchy. The Hanseaten were regarded as being of equal rank to the (landed) nobility elsewhere in Europe,[6] although the Hanseaten often regarded the (rural) nobility outside the city republics as inferior to the (urban and often more affluent, and in their own view, cultivated) Hanseaten. Thomas Mann, a member of a Lübeck Hanseatic family, portrayed this class in his novel Buddenbrooks.

The most republican city was Hamburg, where the nobility was banned, from the 13th century to the 19th century, from owning property, participating in the political life of the city republic, and even from living within its walls. Hamburg, however, was not a true democracy, but rather an oligarchy, with the Hanseaten as its elite occupying the position held by noble and princely families elsewhere. According to Richard J. Evans, \"the wealthy of nineteenth-century Hamburg were for the most part stern republicans, abhorring titles, refusing to accord any deference to the Prussian nobility, and determinedly loyal to their urban background and mercantile heritage.\"[7] Many grand burghers considered the nobility inferior to Hanseatic families.[8] A marriage between a daughter of a Hanseatic family and a noble was often undesired by the Hanseaten.[9] From the late 19th century, being integrated into a German nation state, a number of Hanseatic families were nevertheless ennobled (by other German states, e.g. Prussia), but this was often met with criticism among their fellow Hanseaten. As the Hanseatic banker Johann von Berenberg-Gossler was ennobled in Prussia in 1889, his sister Susanne, married Amsinck, exclaimed \"Aber John, unser guter Name!\"[8] Upon hearing of the ennoblement of Rudolph Schröder (1852–1938) of the ancient Hanseatic Schröder family, Hamburg First Mayor Johann Heinrich Burchard remarked that the Prussian King could indeed \"place\" (versetzen) Schröder among the nobles, but he could not \"elevate\" (erheben) an Hanseatic merchant.[8] Hanseatic families[edit] A few prominent families are listed here.

Blankenese is a former independent town, now a suburban quarter in the borough Altona in the western part of Hamburg (Germany). It is located on right bank of the Elbe river. In 2006 the population was 13,011.

In 1060, Archbishop Adalbert of Bremen built a provost's residence at the site of an older settlement at the hill Süllberg. Later the counts of Holstein built a castle. Both were destroyed through Hamburg.[1] Until 1927 Blankenese was an independent town in Holstein and then it was merged into the town Altona by law. In 1938 Altona was merged into Hamburg with the Greater Hamburg Act.[1] During World War II, the suburb held a Luftwaffe Officer Cadet camp, which became HQ 85 Group Signals for the Royal Air Force in 1945.[2] Origin of the name[edit] Blankenese comes from the Low German blanc ness, meaning white promontory in the Elbe river.[1] Geography[edit] According to the 2006 records of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holsteins' statistical office, Blankenese comprises a total area of 8.3 square kilometres (3.2 square miles). Blankenese is located south of Sülldorf, east of Rissen and west of Nienstedten. To the south is the widest point of the river Elbe (2.8 km) which provides various tourist and recreational opportunities as well as a view of the Airbus plant. The stunning views from the river-facing portions of Blankenese have resulted in highly desirable properties and expensive real estate prices. The steep hillside residences boast many tiny, pedestrian-only streets and 4,864 stairs. The Strandweg is home to the Strand Hotel, built in 1902, as well as several other cafes and restaurants. There are two lighthouses, a Roman garden, a doll museum and many parks and walking trails in Blankenese. Parks[edit] Baurspark Bismarckstein Park Gosslerspark Hessepark Hirschpark (Deer Park) Sven-Simon-Park Demographics[edit] In 2006 there were 13,011 people living in Blankenese. The population density was 1,577 /km2 (4,084 /sq mi). Of the total population 16.7% were children under the age of 18, 24.2% were 65 years of age or older, and 10.2% were immigrants. 189 people were registered as unemployed.[3] In 1999 there were 6,990 households out of which 16.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them and 47.1% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 1.97.[4] Education[edit] There are 3 elementary schools and 3 secondary schools:[5]Gymnasium Willhöden, Gymnasium Blankenese and Gesamtschule Blankenese.[6] Infrastructure[edit] A local office of the main district office Altona called Customer Centre Blankenese is located Sülldorfer Kirchenweg.[6] The local quarter court Amtsgericht Hamburg-Blankenese is located Dormienstrasse.[6] The Honorary Consulate of the Kingdom of Morocco (Al Mamlakah al Maghribiyah) established in Hamburg in 1960 is located on the street In de Bargen.[7] Commerce[edit] Blankeneser Landstrasse and Blankenese Bahnhofstrasse form the main intersection of commercial activities in Bankenese. While the shops, banks and post office are open normal business hours from Monday through Saturday, the popular public farmer's market is only available on Tuesday, Friday & Saturday. Health systems[edit] The hospital Tabea GmbH, located Kösterbergstrasse, has 32 beds and is specialized for hip and knee surgery and varicose vein surgery.[8] There were also 73 physicians in private practice and 5 pharmacies.[5] Transportation[edit]     Blankenese station   Blankenese is serviced by the rapid transit system of the S-Bahn with the Blankenese station and several buses of the public transport organisation. According to the Department of Motor Vehicles (Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt), there were 6,333 private cars registered (486 cars/1000 people).[5] As of the summer of 2008, the main train station in Blankenese is being completely rebuilt. Blankenese's waterfront is serviced many times a day by various, inexpensive water shuttles. There are many buoys in the river to help guide all sizes of watercraft, since this part of the river has many sandbars and is subject to the tides. Notable people[edit] Rudolph Crasemann Johann Cesar VI. Godeffroy Karen Horney Web presence[edit] Blankense has its own website which posts recent pictures and news events for its residents. Additionally, one can view live webcam feeds from up and down the Elbe River, starting with the harbor all the way to Cuxhafen. These webcams[9] allow virtual visitors of Blankenese to watch the many commercial container and pleasure ships travel up and down the Elbe in real time.

Amerika (novel) Amerika, also known as The Man Who Disappeared[1] and as The Missing Person[2] (German: Der Verschollene), is the incomplete first novel of author Franz Kafka (1883–1924), written between 1911 and 1914[3] and published posthumously in 1927. The novel originally began as a short story titled The Stoker. The novel incorporates many details of the experiences of his relatives who had emigrated to America.The story describes the bizarre wanderings of sixteen-year-old European emigrant Karl Roßmann, who was forced to go to New York to escape the scandal of his seduction by a housemaid. As the ship arrives in the USA, he becomes friends with a stoker who is about to be dismissed from his job. Karl identifies with the stoker and decides to help him; together they go to see the captain of the ship. In a surreal turn of events, Karl's uncle, Senator Jacob, is in a meeting with the captain. Karl does not know that Senator Jacob is his uncle, but Mr. Jacob recognizes him and takes him away from the stoker.\n\nKarl stays with his uncle for some time but is later abandoned by him after making a visit to his uncle's friend without his uncle's full approval. Wandering aimlessly, he becomes friends with two drifters named Robinson and Delamarche. They promise to find him a job, but they sell his suit without permission, eat his food in front of him without offering him any, and ransack his belongings. Finally, Karl departs from them on bad terms after he's offered a job by a manageress at Hotel Occidental. He works there as a lift-boy. One day Robinson shows up drunk at his work asking him for money. Afraid of losing his job being seen talking with a friend, which is forbidden for lift-boys, Karl agrees to lend him money, then commits the far worse offence of bunking a drunk-sick Robinson in the lift-boy dorm.\n\nBeing dismissed for leaving his post, Karl agrees not only to pay for Robinson's taxi, but also joins him. They travel to Delamarche's place. Delamarche is now staying with a wealthy and obese lady named Brunelda. She wants to take in Karl as her servant. Karl refuses, but Delamarche physically forces him to stay and he is imprisoned in her apartment. He tries to break out, but is beaten by Delamarche and Robinson. On the balcony, he chats with a student who tells him he should stay, because it is hard to find a job elsewhere.

It was named after the Lusitani or Lusitanian people (an Indo-European people). Its capital was Emerita Augusta (currently Mérida, Spain), and it was initially part of the Roman Republic province of Hispania Ulterior, before becoming a province of its own in the Roman Empire. Romans first came to the territory around the mid 2nd century BC.[1] A war with Lusitanian tribes followed, from 155 to 139 BC. In 27 BC, the province was created.[2]    Contents  1 Origin of the name 2 Lusitanians 3 War against Rome 4 Roman province 4.1 Division under Augustus (25–20 BC) 4.2 Division under Diocletian 4.3 Governors 4.4 Coloniae and Municipia  5 Notable Lusitanians 6 Portuguese use of the name 7 See also 8 References 9 External links   Origin of the name[edit] The etymology of the origin of the Lusitani who gave the province their name, is unclear. The name may be of Celtic origin: Lus and Tanus, \"tribe of Lusus\", connecting the name with the personal Celtic name Luso and with the god Lugh.[3] Early modern scholars derived the name from Lucis, an ancient people mentioned in Avienus' Ora Maritima and Tan, from Celtic Tan (Stan), or Tain, meaning a region or implying a country of waters, a root word that formerly meant a prince or sovereign governor of a region.[4][5][6] Ancient Romans, such as Pliny the Elder (Natural History, 3.5) and Varro (cited by Pliny), speculated that the name Lusitania was of Roman origin, as when Pliny says lusum enim Liberi Patris aut lyssam cum eo bacchantium nomen dedisse Lusitaniae et Pana praefectum eius universae: that Lusitania takes its name from the lusus associated with Bacchus and the lyssa of his Bacchantes, and that Pan is its governor. Lusus is usually translated as \"game\" or \"play\", while lyssa is a borrowing from the Greek λυσσα, \"frenzy\" or \"rage\", and sometimes rage personified; for later poets, Lusus and Lyssa become flesh-and-blood companions of Bacchus. Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, which portrays Lusus as the founder of Lusitania, extends these ideas, which have no connection with modern etymology. In his work, \"Geography\", the classical geographer Strabo suggests a change had occurred in the use of the name \"Lusitanian\". He mentions a group who had once been called \"Lusitanians\" living north of the Douro river but were called in his day \"Callacans\".[7] Lusitanians[edit]     Iberian Peninsula at about 300 BC.[8]   Main article: Lusitanians The Lusitani, who were Indo-European speakers, established themselves in the region in the 6th century BC, but historians and archeologists are still undecided about their ethnogenesis. Some modern authors consider them to be an indigenous people who were Celticized culturally and possibly also through intermarriage.[1] The archeologist Scarlat Lambrino defended the position that the Lusitanians were a tribal group of Celtic origin related to the Lusones (a tribe that inhabited the east of Iberia). Some have claimed that both tribes came from the Swiss mountains.[citation needed] Others argue that the evidence points to the Lusitanians being a native Iberian tribe, resulting from intermarriage between different local tribes.[citation needed] The first area colonized by the Lusitani was probably the Douro valley and the region of Beira Alta (present day Portugal); in Beira, they stayed until they defeated the Celtici and other tribes, then they expanded to cover a territory that reached Estremadura before the arrival of the Romans. War against Rome[edit]    v t e   Roman conquest of Hispania      Second Punic War First Celtiberian War Lusitanian War Numantine War (Second Celtiberian War) Sertorian War Cantabrian Wars    Main article: Lusitanian War  And yet the country north of the Tagus, Lusitania, is the greatest of the Iberian nations, and is the nation against which the Romans waged war for the longest times —Strabo[9]      Roman conquest of Hispania   The Lusitani are mentioned for the first time in Livy (218 BC) and are described as fighting for the Carthaginians; they are reported as fighting against Rome in 194 BC, sometimes allied with Celtiberian tribes. In 179 BC, the praetor Lucius Postumius Albinus celebrated a triumph over the Lusitani, but in 155 BC, on the command of Punicus (Πουνίκου, perhaps a Carthaginian) first and Cesarus (Καίσαρος) after, the Lusitani reached Gibraltar. Here they were defeated by the praetor Lucius Mummius. From 152 BC onwards, the Roman Republic had difficulties in recruiting soldiers for the wars in Hispania, deemed particularly brutal. In 150 BC, Servius Sulpicius Galba organised a false armistice. While the Lusitani celebrated this new alliance, he massacred them, selling the survivors as slaves; this caused a new rebellion led by Viriathus, who was after many attempts killed by traitors paid by the Romans in 139 BC, after having led a successful guerrilla campaign against Rome and their local allies. Two years after, in 137 BC Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus led a successful campaign against the Lusitani, reaching as far north as the Minho river. Romans scored other victories with proconsul Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus and Gaius Marius (elected in 113 BC), but still the Lusitani resisted with a long guerilla war; they later joined Sertorius' (a renegade Roman General) troops (around 80 BC) and were finally defeated by Augustus (around 28-24 BC). Roman province[edit]     Roman Hispania under Diocletian (AD 293); Lusitania found in the extreme west       Tower of Centum Cellas       The Trajan Alcántara Bridge.       Elaborate geometrically patterned mosaic floors survive at Conimbriga   Division under Augustus (25–20 BC)[edit] With Lusitania (and Asturia and Gallaecia), Rome had completed the conquest of the Iberian peninsula, which was then divided by Augustus (25–20 BC[citation needed] or 16-13 BC[1]) into the eastern and northern Hispania Tarraconensis, the southwestern Hispania Baetica and the western Provincia Lusitana. Originally, Lusitania included the territories of Asturia and Gallaecia, but these were later ceded to the jurisdiction of the new Provincia Tarraconensis and the former remained as Provincia Lusitania et Vettones. Its northern border was along the Douro river, while on its eastern side its border passed through Salmantica (Salamanca)and Caesarobriga (Talavera de la Reina) to the Anas (Guadiana) river. Between 28-24 BC Augustus' military campaigns pacified all Hispania under Roman rule, with the foundation of Roman cities like Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and Bracara Augusta (Braga) to the north, and to the south Emerita Augusta (Mérida) (settled with the emeriti of the Legio V Alaudae and Legio X Gemina legions). Between the time of Augustus and Claudius, the province was divided into three conventus iuridicus, territorial units presided by capital cities with a court of justice and joint Roman/indigenous people assemblies (conventus), that counseled the Governor: Conventus Emeritensis, with capital in Emerita Augusta (Mérida, Spain) Conventus Scalabitanus, with capital in Scalabis Iulia (Santarém, Portugal) Conventus Pacensis, with capital in Pax Iulia (Beja, Portugal) The conventus ruled of a total of 46 populis, 5 being Roman colonies[10] (Emerita Augusta (Mérida, Spain), Pax Iulia (Beja), Scalabis (Santarém), Norba Caesarina and Metellinum). Felicitas Iulia Olisipo (Lisbon) was a Roman law municipality) and 3 other towns had the old Latin status[11] (Ebora (Évora), Myrtilis Iulia (Mértola) and Salacia (Alcácer do Sal). The other 37 were of stipendiarii class, among which Aeminium (Coimbra), Balsa (Tavira), or Mirobriga (Santiago do Cacém). Other cities include Ossonoba (Faro), Cetobriga (Tróia, Setúbal), Collippo (Leiria) or Arabriga (Alenquer). Division under Diocletian[edit] Under Diocletian, Lusitania kept its borders and was ruled by a praeses, later by a consularis; finally, in 298 AD, it was united with the other provinces to form the Diocesis Hispaniarum (\"Diocese of the Hispanias\"). Governors[edit] Sextus (possibly Gaius) Julius Saturninus Marcus Salvius Otho Caesar Augustus Governor from 58 to 68[12] Sextus Tigidius Perennis Vettius Agorius Praetextatus Coloniae and Municipia[edit] Colonia Metellinum (Medellín, Badajoz) Colonia Norba Caesarina (Cáceres) Colonia Augusta Emerita (Mérida), provincial capital.

The 16th century colony, which would develop into Brazil, was named Nova Lusitânia (\"New Lusitania\"). In common use are such terms as Lusophone, meaning Portuguese-speaking, and Lusitanic, referring to the Community of Portuguese Language Countries — once Portugal's colonies and presently independent countries still sharing some common heritage.

page \"HAFENKAPITAEN\" does not exist. KAPITAEN A sea captain (also called a captain or a master or a shipmaster) is a licensed mariner in ultimate command of the vessel.[1] The captain is responsible for its safe and efficient operation, including cargo operations, navigation, crew management and ensuring that the vessel complies with local and international laws, as well as company and flag state policies. All persons on board, including officers and crew, other shipboard staff members, passengers, guests and pilots, are under the captain's authority and are his ultimate responsibility.\nA ship's captain commands and manages all ship's personnel, and is typically in charge of the ship's accounting, payrolls, and inventories. The captain is responsible for compliance with immigration and customs regulations, maintaining the ship's certificates and documentation, compliance with the vessel's security plan, as mandated by the International Maritime Organization. The captain is responsible for responding to and reporting in case of accidents and incidents, and in case of injuries and illness among the ship's crew and passengers.\n\nA ship's captain must have a master's license or certificate,[clarification needed] issued by the ship's flag state. Various types of licenses exist, specifying the maximum vessel size indicated in gross tonnage and in what geographic areas the captain can operate. An unlimited master's license or certificate (usually known as a master mariner's certificate) allows the captain to operate any vessel worldwide. Restricted tonnage licenses include vessel categories down to 100 tons gross tonnage and below. Examples of licenses with restricted geographic scope include those issued by the United States Coast Guard for the Great Lakes, inland waters, and near coastal waters or issued by the UK Maritime & Coastguard Agency for near coastal voyages. A candidate for an unlimited master's license requires several years[clarification needed] of seagoing experience as a deck officer and must have completed various nautical studies at a maritime college or academy.\nThe captain ensures that the ship complies with local and international laws and complies also with company policies.The captain is ultimately responsible, under the law, for aspects of operation such as the safe navigation of the ship,its cleanliness and seaworthiness,[ safe handling of all cargo,[4] management of all personnel, inventory of ship's cash and stores, and maintaining the ship's certificates and documentation.\n\nOne of a shipmaster's particularly important duties is to ensure compliance with the vessel's security plan, as required by the International Maritime Organization's ISPS Code.The plan, customized to meet the needs of each individual ship, spells out duties including conducting searches and inspections, maintaining restricted spaces,[9] and responding to threats from terrorists, hijackers, pirates, and stowaways. The security plan also covers topics such as refugees and asylum seekers, smuggling, and saboteurs.]\n\nOn ships without a purser, the captain is in charge of the ship's accounting. This includes ensuring an adequate amount of cash on board, coordinating the ship's payroll (including draws and advances), and managing the ship's slop chest.\n\nOn international voyages, the captain is responsible for satisfying requirements of the local immigration and customs officials.[16] Immigration issues can include situations such as embarking and disembarking passengers, handling crewmembers who desert the ship, making crew-changes in port, and making accommodations for foreign crewmembers. Customs requirements can include the master providing a cargo declaration, a ship's stores declaration, a declaration of crewmembers' personal effects, crew lists and passenger lists.\n\nThe captain has special responsibilities when the ship or its cargo are damaged, when the ship causes damage to other vessels or facilities, and in the case of injury or death of a crewmember or passenger. The master acts as a liaison to local investigators and is responsible for providing complete and accurate logbooks, reports, statements and evidence to document an incident. Specific examples of the ship causing external damage include collisions (two ships collide with each other), allisions (one ship collides with fixed object), grounding the vessel, and dragging anchor. Some common causes of cargo damage include heavy weather, water damage, pilferage, and damage caused during loading/unloading by the stevedores.[ Finally, the master is responsible to address any medical issues affecting the passengers and crew by providing medical care as possible, cooperating with shore-side medical personnel, and, as necessary, evacuating those who need more assistance than can be provided on board the ship","path":[85440,10.0033,53.52571,83940,10.00334,53.52575,83820,10.00341,53.52577,83640,10.00341,53.52577,82320,10.00326,53.52571,82200,10.0034,53.52569,82080,10.00331,53.52573,81900,10.00325,53.52568,81660,10.00319,53.52561,80460,10.0034,53.52569,79200,10.00329,53.52575,77940,10.00328,53.52564,77460,10.00334,53.52575,76980,10.0033,53.52563,76500,10.0033,53.52563,76140,10.00333,53.52577,76020,10.00314,53.52564,75840,10.00314,53.52564,75660,10.00314,53.52564,75540,10.00327,53.52557,74460,10.00327,53.52569,73020,10.00325,53.52565,71820,10.00329,53.52565,71700,10.00324,53.52563,71580,10.00331,53.52557,71460,10.00324,53.52553,71340,10.00329,53.52565,71220,10.00332,53.52569,70560,10.0032,53.52573,69300,10.00328,53.52564,67920,10.00329,53.52571,66720,10.00317,53.52557,65340,10.00317,53.52569,63960,10.00323,53.52572,62580,10.00325,53.52569,61200,10.00318,53.52568,59820,10.00321,53.52575,58440,10.0032,53.5257,58320,10.00323,53.52562,58200,10.00325,53.52562,58080,10.00329,53.52567,57840,10.00317,53.52569,57660,10.00317,53.5257,57420,10.00315,53.52567,57180,10.00328,53.52565,56340,10.00314,53.52571,55080,10.00319,53.52568,53760,10.00327,53.52577,52380,10.00328,53.52565,51180,10.00327,53.52568,49980,10.00322,53.52569,48720,10.00334,53.52563,47340,10.00326,53.52596,46140,10.00323,53.52575,44940,10.00335,53.52565,43740,10.00335,53.52565,42540,10.00327,53.5257,42300,10.00321,53.52565,42120,10.0031,53.52583,42000,10.00044,53.52818,41820,9.994057,53.53295,41580,9.98629,53.53795,41400,9.97688,53.54034,41220,9.96706,53.54297,41040,9.964315,53.54504,40860,9.97318,53.5448,39720,9.97259,53.54491,38340,9.97259,53.54494,36960,9.97257,53.54492,35580,9.97256,53.54491,34320,9.9729,53.54485,34140,9.975518,53.54395,33960,9.982529,53.5437,33780,9.991194,53.54448,33420,9.991569,53.54427,33180,9.987473,53.54424,33000,9.979914,53.54161,32820,9.967321,53.54305,32640,9.954567,53.54303,32460,9.943646,53.54164,32280,9.9292,53.54101,32100,9.916255,53.54135,31920,9.902832,53.54111,31740,9.888093,53.54058,31560,9.880247,53.54028,31320,9.882526,53.54233,31140,9.92242,53.5407,30960,9.918348,53.54221,30780,9.9339,53.53796,30600,9.9378,53.53254,30420,9.929822,53.53863,30240,9.91811,53.54072,30060,9.903033,53.54034,29880,9.897322,53.53585,29700,9.900739,53.53881,29520,9.88833,53.54097,29340,9.87348,53.54257,29160,9.859444,53.54403,28980,9.849112,53.5453,28800,9.839517,53.54663,28680,9.833611,53.54785,28500,9.829297,53.5473,28320,9.839768,53.54557,28140,9.85149,53.54455,27960,9.86516,53.54231,27780,9.878268,53.53793,27600,9.887638,53.53269,27420,9.891303,53.52625,27240,9.890083,53.5239,27060,9.889303,53.53075,26880,9.881719,53.53602,26700,9.879293,53.54041,25680,9.879791,53.54034,25560,9.879795,53.54033,25380,9.890115,53.54177,25200,9.906595,53.54251,25020,9.923072,53.54221,24840,9.93868,53.54206,24660,9.953517,53.5435,24480,9.968677,53.54419,24300,9.981295,53.54189,23580,9.98172,53.54199,22200,9.981725,53.54199,20940,9.982755,53.54122,20760,9.990804,53.53704,20580,9.99912,53.5304,20400,10.00335,53.52567,19440,10.00324,53.52567,18000,10.00315,53.52571,16800,10.00309,53.52567,15360,10.00328,53.52566,13920,10.00327,53.52569,12660,10.00327,53.52581,11460,10.00315,53.52568,10140,10.00321,53.52571,8760,10.00331,53.52569,7320,10.00335,53.52557,6120,10.00329,53.52561,4740,10.0032,53.52567,3360,10.00322,53.5257,1920,10.00329,53.52565,540,10.00333,53.52564]},{"name":"VARUNA","text":"The God Varuna on his mount makara, 1675-1700 Painted in: India, Rajasthan, Bundi placed in LACMA museum  Devanagari वरुण Sanskrit Transliteration Varuṇa Affiliation Aditya,Deva,Guardians of the directions Abode Celestial ocean (Rasā) Planet Venus Mantra Oṃ Vaṃ Varuṇāya Namaḥ Weapon Pasha (Lasso) or Varunastra Consort Varuni Mount Makara In Vedic religion, Varuna (Sanskrit Varuṇa वरुण, Malay: Baruna) or Waruna, is a god of the water and of the celestial ocean, as well as a god of law of the underwater world. A Makara is his mount. In Hindu mythology, Varuna continued to be considered the god of all forms of the water element, particularly the oceans.    Contents  1 In the Vedas 2 Similarities with other gods 3 In the Ramayana 4 In Contemporary Hinduism 5 In Zoroastrianism 6 In Modern Age 7 Notes 8 See also   In the Vedas[edit] As chief of the Adityas, Varuna has aspects of a solar deity though, when opposed to Mitra (Vedic term for Surya), he is rather associated with the night, and Mitra with the daylight. As the most prominent Deva, however, he is mostly concerned with moral and societal affairs than being a deification of nature. Together with Mitra–originally 'agreement' (between tribes) personified—being master of ṛtá, he is the supreme keeper of order and god of the law. The word ṛtá, order, is also translated as \"season\". Varuna and Mitra are the gods of the societal affairs including the oath, and are often twinned Mitra-Varuna (a dvandva compound). Varuna is also twinned with Indra in the Rigveda, as Indra-Varuna (when both cooperate at New Year in re-establishing order [1]). The Rigveda and Atharvaveda[2] portrays Varuna as omniscient, catching liars in his snares. The stars are his thousand-eyed spies, watching every movement of men. In the Rigveda, Indra, chief of the Devas, is about six times more prominent than Varuna, who is mentioned 341 times. This may misrepresent the actual importance of Varuna in early Vedic society due to the focus of the Rigveda on fire and Soma ritual, Soma being closely associated with Indra; Varuna with his omniscience and omnipotence in the affairs of men has many aspects of a supreme deity. The daily Sandhyavandanam ritual of a dvija addresses Varuna in this aspect in its evening routine, asking him to forgive all sins, while Indra receives no mention. Both Mitra and Varuna are classified as Asuras in the Rigveda (e.g. RV 5.63.3), although they are also addressed as Devas as well (e.g. RV 7.60.12), possibly indicating the beginning of the negative connotations carried by Asura in later times. In post-Vedic texts Varuna became the god of oceans and rivers and keeper of the souls of the drowned. As such, Varuna is also a god of the dead, and can grant immortality. He is attended by the nagas. He is also one of the Guardians of the directions, representing the west. Later art depicts Varuna as a lunar deity, as a yellow man wearing golden armor and holding a noose or lasso made from a snake. He rides the sea creature Makara. Similarities with other gods[edit] Varuna is often compared to the Greek god Poseidon and the Roman god Neptune as they are all water deities who ride on celestial sea animals. Varuna rides on the Makara while Poseidon does so on the Ketos. They both are sometimes depicted as wielding nooses and tridents, and are both considered an elder brother to the ruling deities in Vedic and Greek mythology respectively: Indra and Zeus.[3] In the Ramayana[edit]     Raja Ravi Varma Painting - 'Rama Conquers Varuna'   Faced with the dilemma of how to cross the ocean to Lanka, where his abducted wife Sita is held captive by the demon king Ravana, Rama (an Avatar of Vishnu) performs a penance (tapasya) to Varuna, the Lord of Oceans, fasting and meditating in perfect dhyana for three days and three nights. Varuna does not respond, and Rama arises on the fourth morning, enraged by the God's arrogance. With his bow and arrow, he angrily begins attacking the oceans with celestial weapons—burning up the waters and killing its life and creatures. The Vanaras (Monkeys) are dazzled and fearful at witnessing the enraged Rama demolish the oceans, and his brother, Lakshmana, prays to calm Rama's mind. Just as Rama invokes the brahmastra, considered the most powerful weapon capable of destroying all creation, Varuna arises out of the oceans. He bows to Rama, explaining that he himself was at a loss to answer Rama's question. Begging him not to destroy the oceans with the missile, he suggests that Rama re-direct the weapon at a demonic race that lives in the heart of the ocean. Rama's arrows destroys the demons, and establishes a purer, liberated environment there. Varuna promises that he would keep the oceans still for all of Rama's army to pass, and Nala constructs a bridge (Rama's Bridge) across to Lanka. Rama justifies his angry assault on the oceans as he followed the correct process of petitioning and worshipping Varuna, but obtaining the result by force for the greater good.[4] In Contemporary Hinduism[edit] Worship of Varuna is an integral part of the evening ritual of the Sandhyavandanam, of a dvija Hindu. However, popular worship is primarily limited to Hindus of Sindhi origin. (See Jhulelal) In Zoroastrianism[edit] \"Varun\" is one of 101 names of Ahura Mazda, meaning \"Deliverer from evil\". Varuna is not attested in the texts of the Avesta. The closest sea deity in Zoroastrian cosmology is Vourukasha; and the nearest homonym is Varena, the four-cornered fourteenth region of the world (Vendidad 1.17) and populated by \"fiends\" and \"savage, non-Aryan natives\" (Vd 7.10). In Yasht 15, Haoshyangha begs for a boon that he might smite \"two-thirds of the daevas of Mazana and of the fiends of Varena\". (Yt 15.2.6) An individual who does not follow daena \"[the good] religion\" is an anya-varena. (Yasna 16.2; Vd 12.21, 15.2) Too late to be of relevance to a reconstruction of what might have happened to Indo-Iranian *vouruna (if at all such a predecessor figure existed) in Iran is the \"Varuna\" of the circa 9th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition (the so-called \"Pahlavi\" texts), and in the early New Persian Shahnameh. In both cases this Varuna is a dim-witted, easily tricked demon of \"backwards\"-ness, which is the literal Middle Persian meaning of his name. Assuming that Vedic Varuna is not a purely Indian development (i.e. assuming that he derives from an Indo-Iranian *vouruna), there are several different theories on what might have happened to Indo-Iranian *vouruna in Iran: Nyberg (Die Religionen des alten Iran, 1938:282ff) sees Varuna represented as the Amesha Spenta Asha Vahishta \"Best Righteousness\", an opinion—with extensions—that Dumezil (Tarpeia 1947:33-113) and Widengren (Die Religionen Irans, 1965:12-13) also follow. This theory is based on Vedic Varuna's role as the principal protector of rta, which in Iran is represented by asha [vahishta]. Kuiper (IIJ I, 1957) proposes that none less than Ahura Mazda is a development from an earlier dvandva *vouruna-mitra. The basis of Kuiper's proposal is that the equivalent of Avestan mazda \"wisdom\" is Vedic medhira, described in Rigveda 8.6.10 as the \"(revealed) insight into the cosmic order\" that Varuna grants his devotees. In Kuiper's view, Ahura Mazda is then a compound divinity in which the propitious characteristics of *mitra negate the unfavorable qualities of *vouruna. Zimmer (Münchner Studien 1984:187-215) observed that Varuna has the byname (cult epithet) bhaga, an adjective that also appears in the Avesta (as baga). It may then be that the Avestan adjective is likewise a cult epithet, the proper name having been forgotten—a not uncommon occurrence. This may be seen to be reflected in Artaxerxes III's invocation of ahuramazda ura mithra baga \"Ahura Mazda, Mithra, and the Baga\" (Boyce, Acta Iranica 21, 1981:59-73). Another epithet of Vedic Varuna is asura, and there may be a remnant of Varuna in those Gathic passages (generally presumed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself) refers to the ahuras (plural) without (aside from Ahura Mazda) explicitly naming them. While Ahura Mazda is uniformly \"the mightiest Ahura\" (e.g. Yasna 33.11), in the only two occurrences of the term where the word does not refer to Ahura Mazda, the poet uses the expression mazdasca ahurano (Yasna 30.9, 31.4). This phrase, generally understood to mean \"the Wise [Mazda] One and the (other) Ahuras\", is in \"common opinion\" (so Boyce 1984:159) recognized as being archaic and in which the other Ahuras are *mitra and *varouna. Boyce (Mithra the King and Varuna the Master, 2001) sees this supported by the younger Avestan dvandvah expression mithra ahura berezanta \"Mithra and the High Lord\", the latter being unambiguously Ahura Berezainti, \"High Lord\" Apam Napat, the third member of the Ahuric triad (Gray, Foundations, 1929:15), and with whose Indian equivalent (also Apam Napat) Vedic Varuna is closely associated. In Modern Age[edit]     Varuna, the Indian Neptune, USS Varuna (1861) & USS Varuna (1943)   Two ships in the United States Navy have been named USS Varuna for Varuna, the Vedic god of oceans and rivers and keeper of the souls of the drowned. The first Varuna was a screw gunboat launched in 1861 and sunk by enemy action in April 1862. The second Varuna (AGP-5) was a motorboat tender, commissioned in 1943 and decommissioned in 1946. INS Varuna is a sail training vessel of the Indian Navy. Varuna was completed in April 1981 by Alcock-Ashdown in Bhavnagar. It can carry 26 cadets. The Varuna class of ship of Indian Navy are sail training vessels. They consist of the following three ships. INS Varuna INS Tarangini INS Sudarshini The dwarf planet candidate 20000 Varuna is named after Varuna.

(German: Hadron-Elektron-Ringanlage, English: Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator) was a particle accelerator at DESY in Hamburg. It began operating in 1992. At HERA, electrons or positrons were collided with protons at a center of mass energy of 318 GeV. It was the only lepton-proton collider in the world while operating. Also, it was on the energy frontier in certain regions of the kinematic range. HERA was closed down on 30 June 2007.[1][2] The HERA tunnel is located under the DESY site and the nearby Volkspark around 15 to 30 m underground and has a circumference of 6.3 km. Leptons and protons were stored in two independent storage rings on top of each other inside this tunnel. There are four interaction regions, which were used by the experiments H1, ZEUS, HERMES and HERA-B. All these experiments were particle detectors. Leptons (electrons or positrons) were pre-accelerated to 450 MeV in the linear accelerator LINAC-II. From there they were injected into the storage ring DESY-II and accelerated further to 7.5 GeV before their transfer into PETRA, where they were accelerated to 14 GeV. Finally they were injected into their storage ring in the HERA tunnel and reached a final energy of 27.5 GeV. This storage ring was equipped with warm (non-superconducting) magnets keeping the leptons on their circular track by a magnetic field of 0.17 Tesla. Protons were obtained from originally negatively charged hydrogen ions and pre-accelerated to 50 MeV in a linear accelerator. They were then injected into the proton synchrotron DESY-III and accelerated further to 7 GeV. Then they were transferred to PETRA where they were accelerated to 40 GeV. Finally, they were injected into their storage ring in the HERA tunnel and reached their final energy of 920 GeV. The proton storage ring used superconducting magnets to keep the protons on track. The lepton beam in HERA became naturally transversely polarised through the Sokolov-Ternov effect. The characteristic build-up time expected for the HERA accelerator was approximately 40 minutes. Spin rotators on either side of the experiments changed the transverse polarisation of the beam into longitudinal polarisation. The positron beam polarisation was measured using two independent polarimeters, the transverse polarimeter (TPOL) and the longitudinal polarimeter (LPOL). Both devices exploit the spin-dependent cross section for Compton scattering of circularly polarised photons off positrons to measure the beam polarisation. The transverse polarimeter was upgraded in 2001 to provide a fast measurement for every positron bunch, and position-sensitive silicon strip and scintillating-fibre detectors were added to investigate systematic effects. On 30 June 2007 at 11:23 pm, HERA was shut down,[2] and dismantling of the four experiments started. HERA's main pre-accelerator PETRA was converted into a synchrotron radiation source, operating under the name PETRA-III since August 2010.

He started publishing while in the fourth grade; he also joined many extracurricular clubs and organization, including pro-Polish independence ones. Due to his involvement in such activities, his grades suffered, and he never passed the matura exam. He returned to Poręba village, and continued writing. He debuted in 1896 with a publication of a poem, patriotic poem Nad grobem matki and several satirical verses. In 1898 he published his first work, collection of short stories, Nowele; that year he also changed his surname in to Smreczyński. He published more works soon thereafter: another collection short stories Nad urwiskiem in 1900, a novel Komornicy (1900), drama Postronni (1903), a verse volume Z tej smutnej ziemi (1903), novel W roztokach (1908) and others.     Orkanówka   In early 1900s he started construction of a new house; the same building would later become the Biographical Museum of Władysław Orkan (Muzeum Biograficzne Władysława Orkana or Orkanówka for short). At that time he also married Maria Zwierzyńska, they would have one child, Zofia. Maria would die three years after giving childbirth, Władysław Orkan, always troubled with finances, would ask his sister to raise his daughter. He would later marry Bronisława Folejewska. During those years he also travelled to Italy, Switzerland and Germany. During the First World War he joined the Polish Legions (4th Regiment). For most of his life he stayed in Poręba village. In addition to writing, he was also an activist for the region, cofounder and member of Podhale Association (Tatras Highlanders Union, 1918) and supporter of peasants’ movement. After the war, he continued to write; particularly notable are lyrical poems constituting a cycle Pochwała życia, the drama Widma (1917–1927), the novel Czantoria (1928–1929) and his articles and essays Listy ze wsi (1925–1927). He died in Kraków; shortly before he could collect the 1930 City of Warsaw’s Award for Literature. He is buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery, but next year he was exhumed and moved to a Remembrance Cemetery at Pęksowy Brzyzk, Zakopane. After his death, many regional organisations were set up under his name, to commemorate his contribution to the culture and prestige of the Podhale region. Works[edit] One of the most common image in his works was the poor Polish village. However his works contain other images as well, for example descriptions of mountain countryside and nature, and humorous elements. His early works were inspired by Stanisław Witkiewicz.

Tolkien's legendarium character Aliases the Mariner Race Half-elven Book(s) The Silmarillion (1977)Unfinished Tales (1980)   Middle-earth portal  Eärendil the Mariner (pronounced [ɛaˈrɛndil]) is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. He is depicted in The Silmarillion, as a child of Men and Elves and a great seafarer who, on his brow, carried the morning star across the sky.    Contents  1 Etymology 2 Internal history 2.1 Family tree  3 Concept and creation 4 In popular culture 5 References 6 External links   Etymology[edit] Eärendil means 'Lover of the Sea' in Tolkien's invented language of Quenya. However, Tolkien borrowed the name from Old English literature. Tolkien states (Letters, 297) that the name comes from Anglo-Saxon éarendel. He was struck by its \"great beauty\" c. 1913, which he perceived as  entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a peculiar degree in that pleasing but not 'delectable' language.  There is a poem by Tolkien dated to 1914 entitled \"The Voyage of Eärendel the Evening Star\" (published in The Book of Lost Tales 2 267–269). Tolkien was also aware of the name's Germanic cognates (Old Norse Aurvandill, Lombardic Auriwandalo), and the question why the Anglo-Saxon one rather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in the mythology is alluded to in The Notion Club Papers. The Old Norse together with the Anglo-Saxon evidence point to an astronomical myth, the name referring to a star, or a group of stars, and the Anglo-Saxon in particular points to the morning star as the herald of the rising Sun (in Crist Christianized to refer to John the Baptist). Tolkien was particularly inspired by the lines in the Crist written by Cynewulf:[1] éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum sended \"Hail Earendel, brightest of angels, over Middle-earth to men sent\" which can be taken as the inspiration not only for the role of Eärendil in Tolkien's work, but also for the term Middle-earth (translating Middangeard) for the inhabitable lands (c.f. Midgard). The first line is paralleled by Frodo Baggins' exclamation in The Two Towers (the line appears in The Return of the King in the Peter Jackson films), Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima! which is Quenya, and translates to \"Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars!\" Frodo's exclamation was in reference to the 'Star-glass' he carried, which contained the light of Eärendil's star, the Silmaril. Internal history[edit] The son of Tuor and Idril, daughter of Turgon, Eärendil was raised in Gondolin. When Eärendil was seven years old, he escaped the sacking of Gondolin with his parents, living afterwards in Arvernien by the mouth of Sirion. Eärendil later became the leader of the people who lived there, and married Elwing, daughter of Dior the son of Beren and Lúthien. They had two sons, Elrond and Elros. With the aid of Círdan the Shipwright, Eärendil built a ship, Vingilótë (or Vingilot), which is Quenya for \"foam-flower\". He sailed this often around the seas west of Middle-earth, leaving his wife behind in Arvernien. At this time Elwing had in her possession the Silmaril that Beren had wrested from Morgoth. News of this came to the sons of Fëanor who were still living, and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, and killed most of them. Elwing, rather than be captured, threw herself with the Silmaril into the sea. The Silmaril was not lost, however. According to The Silmarillion:  For Ulmo bore up Elwing out of the waves, and he gave her the likeness of a great white bird, and upon her breast there shone as a star the Silmaril, as she flew over the water to seek Eärendil her beloved. On a time of night Eärendil at the helm of his ship saw her come towards him, as a white cloud exceeding swift beneath the moon, as a star over the sea moving in strange courses, a pale flame on wings of storm. And it is sung that she fell from the air upon the timbers of Vingilot, in a swoon, nigh unto death for the urgency of her speed, and Eärendil took her to his bosom; but in the morning with marvelling eyes he beheld his wife in her own form beside him with her hair upon his face, and she slept.  Hearing of the tragedy that had befallen in Arvernien, Eärendil then sought after Valinor, aboard the Vingilot with Aerandir, Erellont, and Falathar, and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Eärendil thus became the first of all mortals to set foot in Valinor. Eärendil then went before the Valar, and asked them for aid for Men and Elves in Middle-earth, to fight against Morgoth; the Valar accepted his plea. Because Eärendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves, and not for his own sake, Manwë forbore to deal out the punishment of death that was due. Also, because both Eärendil and Elwing were descended from a union of Elves and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the gift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was further passed to the children of Elrond, who became known as the Half-elven). Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. Eärendil would have rather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose to be one of the Elves. The Silmarillion says this:  Now when first Vingilot was set to sail in the seas of heaven, it rose unlooked for, glittering and bright; and the people of Middle-earth beheld it from afar and wondered, and they took it for a sign, and called it Gil-Estel, the Star of High Hope.  The Valar, having listened to Eärendil's plea, went with a mighty host to Middle-earth, and overthrew Morgoth. Eärendil took part in the battle, riding on Vingilot beside Thorondor and the Eagles. He struck down the great dragon Ancalagon and cast him down onto Thangorodrim, the event which, along with the sheer devastation caused by the War of Wrath, led to the Ruin of Beleriand. However, right before the Dagor Dagorath, the Last Battle, Morgoth will escape out the Door of Night to destroy Arda. It is implied Eärendil shall participate in that, alongside every creature in Middle-earth, good and evil.

Already around 1915 he had the idea that this language needed an internal history and was spoken by Elves whom his invented character Eärendil meets during his journeys.[2] The next step in the creation of the underlying mythology was the Lay of Earendel, a work composed of several poems that describes the mariner Earendel and his voyages and how his ship is turned into a star. The mysterious land of Valinor and its Two Trees of gold and silver were first described in this cycle.[3] Tolkien's legend of Eärendil has elements resembling the medieval Celtic Immram legends or the Christian legend of St. Brendan the Navigator. Humphrey Carpenter in his biography of Tolkien remarked that Eärendil \"was in fact the beginning of Tolkien's own mythology\".[1] In popular culture[edit] A species of fossil mammals from the Paleocene was named Earendil undomiel by Leigh Van Valen in 1978.[4] The name translates to 'Earendil Evenstar'.

(Latin for new thing) is a term used by science fiction scholar Darko Suvin and others to describe the scientifically plausible innovations used by science fiction narratives. He argues that the genre of Science Fiction is distinguished from Fantasy by the story being driven by a novum validated by cognitive logic. This means that the hypothetical 'new thing' which the story is about can be imagined to exist by scientific means rather than by magic.

It is an important estuary of the Rhine-Meuse delta. Near Numansdorp, the Hollands Diep splits into the Haringvliet and the Volkerak estuaries. It is closed off near Goedereede from the North Sea by the Haringvlietdam, which provides a road connection between the island of Voorne to the north and the island of Goeree-Overflakkee to the south. The dam with its sluices was built as part of the Delta Works sea barrier protection works, and allow for a brackish ecological environment. The Haringvliet estuary contains the island of Tiengemeten, which is separated from the river island of Hoeksche Waard by the Vuile Gat strait.

She is a sister ship of AIDAdiva, AIDAbella, AIDAblu, AIDAsol, and AIDAmar. The first order was only for two ships, but the option extended to six ships.[9][10] She floated out of drydock on 10 February 2009.[11]AIDAluna started her sea trials with her passage on the River Ems on 21 February 2009, departing Papenburg. The voyage culminated in Emdem the next day. On 23 February, departing Emdem to continue sea trials, she ventured to Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg for final inspection at dock Elbe 17. During the inspection, an object was seen, being tangled on AIDAluna's propellers, which was supposedly caused by the ship's short trip. After a few days, AIDAluna was cleared and continued her sea trials in the North Sea.[12]AIDAluna was delivered to its owners on 16 March 2009.[3] She was christened on April 4, 2009 at Palma de Mallorca by the German supermodel, Franziska Knuppe.

At the time of writing, the 5,000 dwt, 8,053gt vessel claimed the distinction of being the world’s most powerful AHTS with a 344 tonne bollard pull.\nThe hybrid propulsion power plant comprises two 7,680kW medium speed Wärtsila 16V32 mechanically-controlled diesels each driving a Wärtsila/Lips 4.6m diameter 11,180kW FP propeller for a maximum speed of 18.9 knots. Each main engine also drives a 4,000kW ABB M6-FG 3 shaft generator with a 3,500kW PTI electric motor.\nAuxiliary power is generated by means of four 2,100 kWe Caterpillar 3516 gensets and one 340 kWe Caterpillar C18 emergency generator. These gensets power a collection of Rolls-Royce propulsors comprising two 1,200kW TT2400 DPNFP bow thrusters, one UL2001 FP 1,500kW retractable azimuth thruster forward, one 1,200kW TT2400 DPNFP stern thruster and one 1,500kW UL2001 FP retractable azimuth thruster aft. To further aid manoeuvrability, the vessel is fitted with two Becker SC-2550/580 K2 rudders. A Kongsberg Maritime dynamic positioning system is installed for a DP2 capability.\nThe newbuilding is capable of carrying out sub-sea construction work and is fitted with a ROV roller gate and ROV side-door from TTS.

Freyja is the owner of the necklace Brísingamen, rides a chariot pulled by two cats, keeps the boar Hildisvíni by her side, possesses a cloak of falcon feathers, and, by her husband Óðr, is the mother of two daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi. Along with her brother Freyr (Old Norse the \"Lord\"), her father Njörðr, and her mother (Njörðr's sister, unnamed in sources), she is a member of the Vanir. Stemming from Old Norse Freyja, modern forms of the name include Freya, Freija, Frejya, Freyia, Fröja, Frøya, Frøjya, Freia, Freja, Frua and Freiya.Freyja rules over her heavenly afterlife field Fólkvangr and there receives half of those that die in battle, whereas the other half go to the god Odin's hall, Valhalla. Within Fólkvangr is her hall, Sessrúmnir. Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful jötnar who wish to make her their wife. Freyja's husband, the god Óðr, is frequently absent. She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names. Freyja has numerous names, including Gefn, Hörn, Mardöll, Sýr, Valfreyja, and Vanadís.Freyja is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; in the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, the two latter written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century; in several Sagas of Icelanders; in the short story Sörla þáttr; in the poetry of skalds; and into the modern age in Scandinavian folklore, as well as the name for Friday in many Germanic languages.Scholars have theorized about whether Freyja and the goddess Frigg ultimately stem from a single goddess common among the Germanic peoples; about her connection to the valkyries, female battlefield choosers of the slain; and her relation to other goddesses and figures in Germanic mythology, including the thrice-burnt and thrice-reborn Gullveig/Heiðr, the goddesses Gefjon, Skaði, Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa, Menglöð, and the 1st century CE \"Isis\" of the Suebi. Freyja's name appears in numerous place names in Scandinavia, with a high concentration in southern Sweden. Various plants in Scandinavia once bore her name, but it was replaced with the name of the Virgin Mary during the process of Christianization. Rural Scandinavians continued to acknowledge Freyja as a supernatural figure into the 19th century, and Freyja has inspired various works of art.The name Freyja is transparently \"lady\" and ultimately derives from Proto-Germanic *fraw(j)ōn. Freyja is cognate with, for example, Old Saxon frūa \"lady, mistress\" and Old High German frouwa (compare modern German Frau \"lady\").[1] The theonym Freyja is thus considered to have been an epithet in origin, replacing a personal name that is now unattested.[2] As a result, either the original name became entirely taboo or another process occurred in which the goddess is a duplicate or hypostasis of another known goddess; see \"Relation to Frigg and other goddesses and figures\" below.In the Poetic Edda, Freyja is mentioned or appears in the poems Völuspá Grímnismál, Lokasenna, Þrymskviða, Oddrúnargrátr, and Hyndluljóð.Völuspá contains a stanza that mentions Freyja, referring to her as \"Óð's girl\"; Freyja being the wife of her husband, Óðr. The stanza recounts that Freyja was once promised to an unnamed builder, later revealed to be a jötunn and subsequently killed by Thor (recounted in detail in Gylfaginning chapter 42; see Prose Edda section below).[3] In the poem Grímnismál, Odin (disguised as Grímnir) tells the young Agnar that every day Freyja allots seats to half of those that are slain in her hall Fólkvangr, while Odin owns the other half.[4]In the poem Lokasenna, where Loki accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity and/or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between Loki and Freyja. The introduction to the poem notes that among other gods and goddesses, Freyja attends a celebration held by Ægir. In verse, after Loki has flyted with the goddess Frigg, Freyja interjects, telling Loki that he is insane for dredging up his terrible deeds, and that Frigg knows the fate of everyone, though she does not tell it. Loki tells her to be silent, and says that he knows all about her—that Freyja is not lacking in blame, for each of the gods and elves in the hall have been her lover. Freyja objects. She says that Loki is lying, that he is just looking to blather about misdeeds, and since the gods and goddesses are furious at him, he can expect to go home defeated. Loki tells Freyja to be silent, calls her a malicious witch, and conjures a scenario where Freyja was once astride her brother when all of the gods, laughing, surprised the two. Njörðr interjects—he says that a woman having a lover other than her husband is harmless, and he points out that Loki has borne children, and calls Loki a pervert. The poem continues in turn.[5]The poem Þrymskviða features Loki borrowing Freyja's cloak of feathers and Thor dressing up as Freyja to fool the lusty jötunn Þrymr. In the poem, Thor wakes up to find that his powerful hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor tells Loki of his missing hammer, and the two go to the beautiful court of Freyja. Thor asks Freyja if she will lend him her cloak of feathers, so that he may try to find his hammer. Freyja agrees:Loki flies away in the whirring feather cloak, arriving in the land of Jötunheimr. He spies Þrymr sitting on top of a mound. Þrymr reveals that he has hidden Thor's hammer deep within the earth and that no one will ever know where the hammer is unless Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies back, the cloak whistling, and returns to the courts of the gods. Loki tells Thor of Þrymr's conditions.[8]The two go to see the beautiful Freyja. The first thing that Thor says to Freyja is that she should dress herself and put on a bride's head-dress, for they shall drive to Jötunheimr. At that, Freyja is furious—the halls of the gods shake, she snorts in anger, and from the goddess the necklace Brísingamen falls. Indignant, Freyja responds:The gods and goddesses assemble at a thing and debate how to solve the problem. The god Heimdallr proposes to dress Thor up as a bride, complete with bridal dress, head-dress, jingling keys, jewelry, and the famous Brísingamen. Thor objects but is hushed by Loki, reminding him that the new owners of the hammer will soon be settling in the land of the gods if the hammer isn't returned. Thor is dressed as planned and Loki is dressed as his maid. Thor and Loki go to Jötunheimr.[11]In the meantime, Thrym tells his servants to prepare for the arrival of the daughter of Njörðr. When \"Freyja\" arrives in the morning, Thrym is taken aback by her behavior; her immense appetite for food and mead is far more than what he expected, and when Thrym goes in for a kiss beneath \"Freyja's\" veil, he finds \"her\" eyes to be terrifying, and he jumps down the hall. The disguised Loki makes excuses for the bride's odd behavior, claiming that she simply has not eaten or slept for eight days. In the end, the disguises successfully fool the jötnar and, upon sight of it, Thor regains his hammer by force.[12]In the poem Oddrúnargrátr, Oddrún helps Borgny give birth to twins. In thanks, Borgny invokes vættir, Frigg, Freyja, and other unspecified deities.[13]Freyja is a main character in the poem Hyndluljóð, where she assists her faithful servant Óttar in finding information about his ancestry so that he may claim his inheritance. In doing so, Freyja turns Óttar into her boar, Hildisvíni, and, by means of flattery and threats of death by fire, Freyja successfully pries the information that Óttar needs from the jötunn Hyndla. Freyja speaks throughout the poem, and at one point praises Óttar for constructing a hörgr (an altar of stones) and frequently making blót (sacrifices) to her:Freyja appears in the Prose Edda books Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál. In chapter 24 of Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High says that after the god Njörðr split with the goddess Skaði, he had two beautiful and mighty children (no partner is mentioned); a son, Freyr, and a daughter, Freyja. Freyr is \"the most glorious\" of the gods, and Freyja \"the most glorious\" of the goddesses. Freyja has a dwelling in the heavens, Fólkvangr, and that whenever Freyja \"rides into battle she gets half the slain, and the other half to Odin [...].\" In support, High quotes the Grímnismál stanza mentioned in the Poetic Edda section above.[16]High adds that Freyja has a large, beautiful hall called Sessrúmnir, and that when Freyja travels she sits in a chariot and drives two cats, and that Freyja is \"the most approachable one for people to pray to, and from her name is derived the honorific title whereby noble ladies are called fruvor [noble ladies].\" High adds that Freyja has a particular fondness for love songs, and that \"it is good to pray to her concerning love affairs.\"[16]In chapter 29, High recounts the names and features of various goddesses, including Freyja. Regarding Freyja, High says that, next to Frigg, Freyja is highest in rank among them and that she owns the necklace Brísingamen. Freyja is married to Óðr, who goes on long travels, and the two have a very fair daughter by the name of Hnoss. While Óðr is absent, Freyja stays behind and in her sorrow she weeps tears of red gold. High notes that Freyja has many names, and explains that this is because Freyja adopted them when looking for Óðr and traveling \"among strange peoples.\" These names include Gefn, Hörn, Mardöll, Sýr, and Vanadís.[17]Freyja plays a part in the events leading to the birth of Sleipnir, the eight-legged horse. In chapter 42, High recounts that, soon after the gods built the hall Valhalla, a builder (unnamed) came to them and offered to build for them in three seasons a fortification so solid that no jötunn would be able to come in over from Midgard. In exchange, the builder wants Freyja for his bride, and the sun and the moon. After some debate the gods agree, but with added conditions. In time, just as he is about to complete his work, it is revealed that the builder is, in fact, himself a jötunn, and he is killed by Thor. In the mean time, Loki, in the form of a mare, has been impregnated by the jötunn's horse, Svaðilfari, and so gives birth to Sleipnir. In support, High quotes the Völuspá stanza that mentions Freyja.[18] In chapter 49, High recalls the funeral of Baldr and says that Freyja attended the funeral and there drover her cat-chariot, the final reference to the goddess in Gylfaginning.[19]At the beginning of the book Skáldskaparmál, Freyja is mentioned among eight goddesses attending a banquet held for Ægir.[20] Chapter 56 details the abduction of the goddess Iðunn by the jötunn Þjazi in the form of an eagle. Terrified at the prospect of death and torture due to his involvement in the abduction of Iðunn, Loki asks if he may use Freyja's \"falcon shape\" to fly north to Jötunheimr and retrieve the missing goddess. Freyja allows it, and using her \"falcon shape\" and a furious chase by eagle-Þjazi, Loki successfully returns her.[21]In chapter 6, a means of referring to Njörðr is provided that refers to Frejya (\"father of Freyr and Freyja\"). In chapter 7, a means of referring to Freyr is provided that refers to the goddess (\"brother of Freyja\"). In chapter 8, ways of referring to the god Heimdallr are provided, including \"Loki's enemy, recoverer of Freyja's necklace\", inferring a myth involving Heimdallr recovering Freyja's necklace from Loki.[22]In chapter 17, the jötunn Hrungnir finds himself in Asgard, the realm of the gods, and becomes very drunk. Hrungnir boasts that he will move Valhalla to Jötunheimr, bury Asgard, and kill all of the gods—with the exception of the goddesses Freyja and Sif, who he says he will take home with him. Freyja is the only one of them that dares to bring him more to drink. Hrungnir says that he will drink all of their ale. After a while, the gods grow bored of Hrungnir's antics and invoke the name of Thor. Thor immediately enters the hall, hammer raised. Thor is furious and demands to know who is responsible for letting a jötunn in to Asgard, who guaranteed Hrungnir safety, and why Freyja \"should be serving him drink as if at the Æsir's banquet.\"[23]In chapter 18, verses from the 10th century skald's composition Þórsdrápa are quoted. A kenning used in the poem refers to Freyja.[24] In chapter 20, poetic ways to refer to Freyja are provided; \"daughter of Njörðr\", \"sister of Freyr\", \"wife of Óðr\", \"mother of Hnoss\", \"possessor of the fallen slain and of Sessrumnir and tom-cats\", possessor of Brísingamen, \"Van-deity\", Vanadís, and \"fair-tear deity\".[25] In chapter 32, poetic ways to refer to gold are provided, including \"Freyja's weeping\" and \"rain or shower [...] from Freyja's eyes\".[26]Chapter 33 tells that once the gods journeyed to visit Ægir, one of whom was Freyja.[26] In chapter 49, a quote from a work by the skald Einarr Skúlason employs the kenning \"Óðr's bedfellow's eye-rain\", which refers to Freyja and means \"gold\".[27]Chapter 36 explains again that gold can be referring to as Freyja's weeping due to her red gold tears. In support, works by the skalds Skúli Þórsteinsson and Einarr Skúlason are cited that use \"Freyja's tears\" or \"Freyja's weepings\" to represent \"gold\". The chapter features additional quotes from poetry by Einarr Skúlason that references the goddess and her child Hnoss.[28] Freyja receives a final mention in the Prose Edda in chapter 75, where a list of goddesses is provided that includes Freyja.[29]The Heimskringla book Ynglinga saga provides an euhemerized account of the origin of the gods, including Freyja. In chapter 4, Freyja is introduced as a member of the Vanir, the sister of Freyr, and the daughter of Njörðr and his sister (whose name is not provided). After the Æsir–Vanir War ends in a stalemate, Odin appoints Freyr and Njörðr as priests over sacrifices. Freyja becomes the priestess of sacrificial offerings and it was she who introduced the practice of seiðr to the Æsir, previously only practiced by the Vanir.[30]In chapter 10, Freyja's brother Freyr dies, and Freyja is the last survivor among the Æsir and Vanir. Freyja keeps up the sacrifices and becomes famous. The saga explains that, due to Freyja's fame, all women of rank become known by her name—frúvor (\"ladies\"), a woman who is the mistress of her property is referred to as freyja, and húsfreyja (\"lady of the house\") for a woman who owns an estate.[31]The chapter adds that not only was Freyja very clever, but that she and her husband Óðr had two immensely beautiful daughters, Gersemi and Hnoss, \"who gave their names to our most precious possessions.\"[31]Freyja is mentioned in the sagas Egils saga, Njáls saga, Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka, and in Sörla þáttr.In Egils saga, when Egill Skallagrímsson refuses to eat, his daughter Þorgerðr (here anglicized as \"Thorgerd\") says she will go without food and thus starve to death, and in doing so will meet the goddess Freyja:In the first chapter of the 14th century legendary saga Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka, King Alrek has two wives, Geirhild and Signy, and cannot keep them both. He tells the two women that he would keep whichever of them that brews the better ale for him by the time he has returned home in the summer. The two compete and during the brewing process Signy prays to Freyja and Geirhild to Hött (\"hood\"), a man she had met earlier (earlier in the saga revealed to be Odin in disguise). Hött answers her prayer and spits on her yeast. Signy's brew wins the contest.[33]In Sörla þáttr, a short, late 14th century narrative from a later and extended version of the Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar found in the Flateyjarbók manuscript, an euhmerized account of the gods is provided. In the account, Freyja is described as having been a concubine of Odin, who bartered sex to four dwarfs for a golden necklace. In the work, the Æsir once lived in a city called Asgard, located in a region called \"Asialand or Asiahome\". Odin was the king of the realm, and made Njörðr and Freyr temple priests. Freyja was the daughter of Njörðr, and was Odin's concubine. Odin deeply loved Freyja, and she was \"the fairest of woman of that day.\" Freyja had a beautiful bower, and when the door was shut no one could enter without Freyja's permission.[34]Chapter 1 records that one day Freyja passed by an open stone where dwarfs lived. Four dwarfs were smithying a golden necklace, and it was nearly done. Looking at the necklace, the dwarfs thought Freyja to be most fair, and she the necklace. Freyja offered to buy the collar from them with silver and gold and other items of value. The dwarfs said that they had no lack of money, and that for the necklace the only thing she could offer them would be a night with each of them. \"Whether she liked it better or worse\", Freyja agreed to the conditions, and so spent a night with each of the four dwarfs. The conditions were fulfilled and the necklace was hers. Freyja went home to her bower as if nothing happened.[35]As related in chapter 2, Loki, under the service of Odin, found out about Freyja's actions and told Odin. Odin told Loki to get the necklace and bring it to him. Loki said that since no one could enter Freyja's bower against her will, this wouldn't be an easy task, yet Odin told him not to come back until he had found a way to get the necklace. Howling, Loki turned away and went to Freyja's bower but found it locked, and that he couldn't enter. So Loki transformed himself into a fly, and after having trouble finding even the tiniest of entrances, he managed to find a tiny hole at the gable-top, yet even here he had to squeeze through to enter.[35]Having made his way into Freyja's chambers, Loki looked around to be sure that no one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep. He landed on her bed and noticed that she was wearing the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into a flea and jumped onto Freyja's cheek and there bit her. Freyja stirred, turning about, and then fell asleep again. Loki removed his flea's shape and undid her collar, opened the bower, and returned to Odin.[36]The next morning Freyja woke and saw that the doors to her bower were open, yet unbroken, and that her precious necklace was gone. Freyja had an idea of who was responsible. She got dressed and went to Odin. She told Odin of the malice he had allowed against her and of the theft of her necklace, and that he should give her back her jewelry.[37]Odin said that, given how she obtained it, she would never get it back. That is, with one exception: she could have it back if she could make two kings, themselves ruling twenty kings each, battle one another, and cast a spell so that each time one of their numbers falls in battle, they will again spring up and fight again. And that this must go on eternally, unless a Christian man of a particular stature goes into the battle and smites them, only then will they stay dead. Freyja agreed.[37]Although the Christianization of Scandinavia beheld a new institution in Scandinavia, the church, that sought to demonize the native gods, belief and reverence in the gods, including Freyja, remained into the modern period and melded into Scandinavian folklore. Britt-Mari Näsström (sv) comments that Freyja became a particular target under Christianization:However, Freyja did not disappear. In Iceland, Freyja was called upon for assistance by way of Icelandic magical staves as late as the 18th century, and as late as the 19th century, Freyja is recorded as retaining elements of her role as a fertility goddess among rural Swedes.[39]The Old Norse poem Þrymskviða (or its source) continued into Scandinavian folk song tradition, where it was euhemerized and otherwise transformed over time. In Iceland, the poem became known as Þrylur, whereas in Denmark the poem became Thor af Havsgaard and in Sweden it became Torvisan or Hammarhämtningen.[38] A section of the Swedish Torvisan, in which Freyja has been transformed into \"the fair\" (den väna) Frojenborg, reads as follows:In the province of Småland, Sweden, an account is recorded connecting Freyja with sheet lightning in this respect. Writer Johan Alfred Göth recalled a Sunday in 1880 where men were walking in fields and looking at nearly ripened rye, where Måns in Karryd said: \"Now Freyja is out watching if the rye is ripe\". Along with this, Göth recalls another mention of Freyja in the countryside:In Värend, Sweden, Freyja could also arrive at Christmas night and she used to shake the apple trees for the sake of a good harvest and consequently people left some apples in the trees for her sake. However, it was dangerous to leave the plough outdoors, because if Freyja sat on it, it would no longer be of any use.[40]Several plants were named after Freyja, such as Freyja's tears and Freyja's hair (Polygala vulgaris), but during the process of Christianization, the name of the goddess was replaced with that of the Virgin Mary.[41] In the pre-Christian period, the Orion constellation was called either Frigg's distaff or Freyja's distaff (Swedish Frejerock).[41]Place names in Norway and Sweden reflect devotion to the goddess, including the Norwegian place name Frøihov (originally *Freyjuhof, literally \"Freyja's hof\") and Swedish place names such as Frövi (from *Freyjuvé, literally \"Freyja's vé\").[42] In a survey of toponyms in Norway, M. Olsen tallies at least 20 to 30 location names compounded with Freyja. Three of these place names appear to derive from *Freyjuhof ('Freyja's hof'), whereas the goddess's name is frequently otherwise compounded with words for 'meadow' (such as -þveit, -land) and similar land formations. These toponyms are attested most commonly on the west coast though a high frequency is found in the southeast.[43]Place names containing Freyja are yet more numerous and varied in Sweden, where they are widely distributed. A particular concentration is recorded in Uppland, among which a number derive from the above-mentioned *Freyjuvé and also *Freyjulundr ('Freyja's sacred grove'), place names that indicate public worship of Freyja. In addition, a variety of place names (such as Frøal and Fröale) have been seen as containing an element cognate to Gothic alhs and Old English ealh (\"temple\"), although these place names may be otherwise interpreted. In addition, Frejya appears as a compound element with a variety of words for geographic features such as fields, meadows, lakes, and natural objects such as rocks.[44]The Freyja name Hörn appears in the Swedish place names Härnevi and Järnevi, stemming from the reconstructed Old Norse place name *Hörnar-vé (meaning \"Hörn's vé\").[45]A 7th-century phalara found in a \"warrior grave\" in what is now Eschwege in northwestern Germany features a female figure with two large braids flanked by two \"cat-like\" beings and holding a staff-like object. This figure has been interpreted as Freyja.[46] This image may be connected to various B-type bracteates, referred to as the Fürstenberg-type, that may also depict the goddess; they \"show a female figure, in a short skirt and double-looped hair, holding a stave or sceptre in her right hand and a double-cross feature in the left\".[46]A 12th century depiction of a cloaked but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears on a wall in the Schleswig Cathedral in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Beside her is similarly a cloaked yet otherwise nude woman riding a distaff. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.[47]Due to numerous similarities, scholars have frequently connected Freyja with the goddess Frigg. The connection with Frigg and question of possible earlier identification of Freyja with Frigg in the Proto-Germanic period (Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis) remains a matter of scholarly discourse.[48] Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"[49]Like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir, the name Freyja is not attested outside of Scandinavia, as opposed to the name of the goddess Frigg, who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *Frijjō. Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Freyja descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to lack of evidence.[48]In the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá, a figure by the name of Gullveig is burnt three times yet is three times reborn. After her third rebirth, she is known as Heiðr. This event is generally accepted as precipitating the Æsir–Vanir War. Starting with scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre, scholars such as Rudolf Simek, Andy Orchard, and John Lindow have theorized that Gullveig/Heiðr is the same figure as Freyja, and that her involvement with the Æsir somehow led to the events of the Æsir–Vanir War.[50]Outside of theories connecting Freyja with the goddess Frigg, some scholars, such Hilda Ellis Davidson and Britt-Mari Näsström (sv), have theorized that other goddesses in Norse mythology, such as Gefjon, Gerðr, and Skaði, may be forms of Freyja in different roles and/or ages.[51]Freyja and her afterlife field Fólkvangr, where she receives half of the slain, has been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Scholar Britt-Mari Näsström points out the description in Gylfaginning where it is said of Freyja that \"whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain,\" and interprets Fólkvangr as \"the field of the Warriors\". Näsström notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is Sessrumnir (which she translates as \"filled with many seats\"), a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. Näsström comments that \"still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.\"[52]Siegfried Andres Dobat comments that \"in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm Fólkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar  [sic] and the dísir.\"[53]Gustav Neckel, writing in 1920, connects Freyja to the Phrygian goddess Cybele. According to Neckel, both goddesses can be interpreted as \"fertility goddesses\" and other potential resemblances have been noted. Some scholars have suggested that the image of Cybele subsequently influenced the iconography of Freyja, the lions drawing the former's chariot becoming large cats. These observation became an extremely common observation in works regarding Old Norse religion until at least the early 1990s. In her book-length study of scholarship on the topic of Freyja, Britt-Mari Näsström (1995) is highly critical of this deduction; Näsström says that \"these 'parallels' are due to sheer ignorance about the characteristics of Cybele; scholars have not troubled to look into the resemblances and differences between the two goddesses, if any, in support for their arguments for a common origin.\"[54]Into the modern period, Freyja was treated as a Scandinavian counterpart to the Roman Venus in, for example, Swedish literature, where the goddess may be associated with romantic love or, conversely, simply as a synonym for \"lust and potency\".[55] In the 18th century, Swedish poet Carl Michael Bellman referred to Stockholm prostitutes as \"the children of Fröja\".[38] In the 19th century, Britt-Mari Näsström observes, Swedish Romanticism focused less on Freyja's erotic qualities and more on the image of \"the pining goddess, weeping for her husband\".[38]Freyja is mentioned in the first stanza (\"it is called old Denmark and it is Freja's hall\") of the civil national anthem of Denmark, Der er et yndigt land, written by 19th century Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger in 1819.[56] In addition, Oehlenschläger wrote a comedy entitled Freyjas alter (1818) and a poem Freais sal featuring the goddess.[57]The 19th century German composer Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen opera cycle features Freia, the goddess Freyja combined with the apple-bearing goddess Iðunn.[58]In late 19th century and early 20th century Northern Europe, Freyja was the subject of numerous works of art, including Freyja by H. E. Freund (statue, 1821–1822), Freja sökande sin make (painting, 1852) by Nils Blommér, Freyjas Aufnahme uner den Göttern (charcoal drawing, 1881), and Frigg; Freyja (drawing, 1883) by Carl Ehrenberg, Freyja (1901) by Carl Emil Doepler d. J., and Freyja and the Brisingamen by J. Doyle Penrose (painting, 1862–1932).[57] Like other Norse goddesses, her name was applied widely in Scandinavia to, for example, \"sweetmeats or to stout carthorses\".[59] Vanadís, one of Freyja's names, is the source of the name of the chemical element vanadium, so named because of its many colored compounds.[60]Starting in the early 1990s, derivatives of Freyja began to appear as a given name for girls.[59] According to the Norwegian name database from the Central Statistics Bureau, around 500 women have Frøya (the modern, Norwegian spelling of the goddess's name) as a first name in the country.

In addition to this, the government of the Azores employs a large percentage of the population directly or indirectly in many aspects of the service and tertiary sectors.There are nine major Azorean islands and an islet cluster, in three main groups. These are Flores and Corvo, to the west; Graciosa, Terceira, São Jorge, Pico, and Faial in the centre; and São Miguel, Santa Maria, and the Formigas Reef to the east. They extend for more than 600 km (370 mi) and lie in a northwest-southeast direction.All the islands have volcanic origins, although some, such as Santa Maria, have had no recorded activity since the islands were settled. Mount Pico, on the island of Pico, is the highest point in Portugal, at 2,351 m (7,713 ft). The Azores are actually some of the tallest mountains on the planet, measured from their base at the bottom of the ocean to their peaks, which thrust high above the surface of the Atlantic.Because these once-uninhabited and remote islands were settled sporadically over a span of two centuries, their culture, dialect, cuisine, and traditions vary considerably.A small number of alleged Hypogea, earthen structures carved into rocks that were used for burials, have been identified on the islands of Corvo, Santa Maria and Terceira by Portuguese archaeologist Nuno Ribeiro and speculations were published that they might date back 2000 years, alluding to a human presence on the island before the Portuguese.[9] However, these kinds of structures have always been used in the Azores to store cereals, and suggestions by Ribeiro that they might be burial sites are unconfirmed. Detailed examination and dating to authenticate the validity of these speculations is lacking.[10] So far, it is unclear whether these structures are natural or man-made and whether they predate the 15th-century Portuguese colonization of the Azores. Solid confirmation of a pre-Portuguese human presence in the archipelago has not yet been published.The islands were known in the fourteenth century and parts of them can be seen, for example, in the Atlas Catalan. In 1427, one of the captains sailing for Henry the Navigator, possibly Gonçalo Velho, rediscovered the Azores, but this is not certain. In Thomas Ashe's 1813 work, A History of the Azores,[11] the author identified a Fleming, Joshua Vander Berg of Bruges, who made landfall in the archipelago during a storm on his way to Lisbon.[11] He stated that the Portuguese explored the area and claimed it for Portugal shortly after.[11] Other stories note the discovery of the first islands (São Miguel Island, Santa Maria Island and Terceira Island) were made by sailors in the service of Henry the Navigator, although there are few written documents to support the claims.Although it is commonly said that the archipelago received its name from the goshawk (Açor in Portuguese), a common bird at the time of discovery, it is unlikely that the bird nested or hunted in the islands.At some point, following the discovery of Santa Maria, sheep were let loose on the island before settlement actually took place. This was done to supply the future settlers with food because there were no large animals on the island. Settlement did not take place right away, however. There was not much interest among the Portuguese people in an isolated archipelago hundreds of miles from civilization. However, Cabral patiently gathered resources and settlers for the next three years (1433–1436) and sailed to establish colonies on Santa Maria first and then São Miguel next.Settlers cleared bush and rocks to plant crops—grain, grape vines, sugar cane, and other plants suitable for local use and of commercial value. They brought domesticated animals, such as chickens, rabbits, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs and built houses and established villages.The archipelago was settled over the centuries largely from mainland Portugal. Portuguese settlers came from the provinces of Algarve, Minho, Alentejo and Ribatejo as well as Madeira. São Miguel was first settled in 1444, the settlers – mainly from the Estremadura, Alto Alentejo and Algarve areas of continental Portugal, under the command of Gonçalo Velho Cabral – landing at the site of modern-day Povoação. Many of the early settlers were also Portuguese Sephardic Jews (New Christians - Jews who became Christian through forced conversion) who fled the pressures of inquisition in mainland Portugal. In 1522 Vila Franca do Campo, then the capital of the island, was devastated by a landslide caused by an earthquake that killed about 5,000 people, and the capital was moved to Ponta Delgada. The town of Vila Franca do Campo was rebuilt on the original site and today is a thriving fishing and yachting port. Ponta Delgada received its city status in 1546. Since the first settlement, the pioneers applied themselves to the area of agriculture. By the 15th century Graciosa exported wheat, barley, wine and brandy. The goods were sent to Terceira largely because of the proximity of the island.During the 18th and 19th century, Graciosa was host to many prominent figures, including Chateaubriand, the French writer who passed through upon his escape to America during the French revolution; Almeida Garrett, the Portuguese poet who visited an uncle and wrote some poetry while there; and Prince Albert of Monaco, the 19th century oceanographer who led several expeditions in the waters of the Azores. He arrived on his yacht \"Hirondelle\", and visited the \"furna da caldeira\", the noted hot springs grotto. Author Mark Twain published in 1869, \"The Innocents Abroad\" a travel book, where he described his time in the Azores.The first reference to the island of São Jorge was made in 1439 but the actual date of discovery is unknown. In 1443 the island was already inhabited but active settlement only began with the arrival of the noble Flemish native Wilhelm Van der Haegen. Arriving at Topo, where he lived and died, he became known as Guilherme da Silveira to the islanders. João Vaz Corte-Real received the captaincy of the island in 1483. Velas became a town before the end of the 15th century. By 1490, there were 2,000 Flemings living in the islands of Terceira, Pico, Faial, São Jorge and Flores. Because there was such a large Flemish settlement, the Azores became known as the Flemish Islands or the Isles of Flanders. Prince Henry the Navigator was responsible for this settlement. His sister, Isabel, was married to Duke Philip of Burgundy of which Flanders was a part. There was a revolt against Philip's rule and disease and hunger became rampant. Isabel appealed to Henry to allow some of the unruly Flemings to settle in the Azores. He granted this and supplied them with the necessary transportation and goods.The settlement of the then-unoccupied islands started in 1439 with people mainly from the continental provinces of Algarve and Alentejo. In 1583, Philip II of Spain, as king of Portugal, sent his fleet to clear the Azores of a combined multinational force of adventurers, mercenaries, volunteers and soldiers who were attempting to establish the Azores as a staging post for a rival pretender to the Portuguese throne. Following the success of his fleet at the Battle of Ponta Delgada, the captured enemies were hanged from yardarms, as they were considered pirates by Philip II. This was added to the \"Black Legend\" by his enemies.[citation needed] An English expedition against the Azores in 1597, the Islands Voyage, also failed. Spain held the Azores in what is called The Babylonian captivity of 1580–1642. Into the late 16th century, the Azores as well as Madeira began to face problems of overpopulation. Spawning from that particular economic problem, some of the people began to emigrate to Brazil.[12]Following the death of Henry, the Cardinal-King of Portugal the nation fell into a dynastic crisis with various pretenders to the Crown of Portugal.[13] Following his proclamation in Santarém, António, Prior of Crato was acclaimed in the Azores in 1580 (through his envoy António da Costa), but was expelled from the continent following the Battle of Alcântara.[13] Yet, through the administration of Cipriano de Figueiredo, governor of Terceira (who continued to govern Terceira in the name of ill-fated, former-king Sebastian of Portugal), the Azoreans resisted attempts to conquer the islands (including specifically at the Battle of Salga).[14] It was Figueiredo and Violante do Canto who helped organize a resistance on Terceira that influenced some of the response of the other islands, even as internal politics and support for Philip's faction increased on the other islands (including specifically on São Miguel, where the Gonçalvez da Câmara family supported the Spanish pretender).[14]The Azores were the last part of the Portuguese Empire to resist Philip's reign over Portugal (Macau resisted any official recognition) and were returned to Portuguese control with the end of the Iberian Union in 1640, not by the professional military, who were used in the Restoration War in the mainland, but by local people attacking a fortified Castilian garrison.The Portuguese Civil War (1828–1834) had strong repercussions in the Azores. In 1829, in Praia da Vitória, the Liberals won over the absolutists, making Terceira Island the main headquarters of the new Portuguese regime and also where the Council of Regency (Conselho de Regência) of Maria II of Portugal was established.Beginning in 1868, Portugal issued its stamps overprinted with \"AÇORES\" for use in the islands. Between 1892 and 1906, it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time.From 1836 to 1976, the archipelago was divided into three districts, equivalent (except in area) to those in the Portuguese mainland. The division was arbitrary, and did not follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (none of which were on the western group).In 1931 the Azores (together with Madeira and Portuguese Guinea) revolted against the Ditadura Nacional and were held briefly by military rebels.[15]In 1943, during World War II, the Portuguese ruler António de Oliveira Salazar leased air and naval bases in the Azores to the British Empire.[16] The occupation of these facilities in October 1943 was codenamed Operation Alacrity by the British.[17]This was a key turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic, enabling the Royal Air Force, the U.S. Army Air Forces, and the U.S. Navy to provide aerial coverage in the Mid-Atlantic gap. This helped them to protect convoys and to hunt hostile Kriegsmarine U-boats.In 1944, the American armed forces constructed a small and short-lived air base on the island of Santa Maria. In 1945, a new base was constructed on the island of Terceira, and it is named Lajes Field. This air base is in an area called Lajes, a broad, flat sea terrace that had been a large farm. Lajes Field is a plateau rising out of the sea on the northeast corner of the island. This air base is a joint American and Portuguese venture. Lajes Field continues to support the American and Portuguese Armed Forces. During the Cold War, U.S. Navy P-3 Orion antisubmarine warfare squadrons patrolled the North Atlantic Ocean for Soviet Navy submarines and surface warships. Since its opening, Lajes Field has been used for refuelling American cargo planes bound for Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The U.S. Navy keeps a small squadron of its ships at the harbor of Praia da Vitória, three kilometers southeast of Lajes Field.The airfield also has a small commercial terminal handling scheduled and chartered passenger flights from the other islands in the Azores, Europe, Africa, and North America.In 1976, the Azores became the Autonomous Region of the Azores (Região Autónoma dos Açores), one of the autonomous regions of Portugal, and the subdistricts of the Azores were eliminated.The archipelago of the Azores is located in the middle of the northern hemisphere of the Atlantic Ocean and extends along a west-northwest to east-southeast orientation (between 36.5°–40° North latitudes and 24.5°–31.5° West longitudes) in an area approximately 600 kilometres (373 miles) wide. The islands of the Azores emerged from what is called the Azores Platform, a 5.8 million km2 region that is morphologically accented by a depth of 2000 meters.[18][19]From a geostructural perspective the Azores is located above an active triple junction between three of the world's large tectonic plates (the North American Plate, the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate),[19] a condition that has translated into the existence of many faults and fractures in this region of the Atlantic.[20] The westernmost islands of the archipelago (Corvo and Flores) are located in the North American Plate, while the remaining islands are located within the boundary that divides the Eurasian and African Plates.The principal tectonic structures that exist in the region of the Azores are the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the Terceira Rift, the Azores Fracture Zone and the Glória Fault.[19] The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the main frontier between the American Plate and the African-Eurasian Plates that crosses the Azores Platform between the islands of Flores and Faial from north to south then to the southwest; it is an extensive form crossed by many transform faults running perpendicular to its north-south orientation, that is seismically active and susceptible to volcanism. The Terceira Rift is a system of fractures that extends from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the Glória Fault that represents the main frontier between the Eurasian and African Plates. It is defined by a line of submarine volcanoes and island mounts that extend northwest to southeast for about 550 kilometres (342 miles), from the area west of Graciosa until the islets of the Formigas, that includes the islands of Graciosa, Terceira and São Miguel. Its northwest limit connects to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the southeast section intersects the Gloria Fault southeast of the island of Santa Maria. The Azores Fracture Zone is that extends from the Glória Fault and encompasses a relatively inactive area to the south of the islands of the Central and Eastern groups north to the Terceira Rift, along a 45° angle. The Glória Fault, for its part, extends 800 kilometres (497 miles) along a linear line from the Azores to the Azores–Gibraltar Transform Fault.[21]The island's volcanism is associated with the rifting along the Azores Triple Junction; the spread of the crust along the existing faults and fractures has produced many of the active volcanic and seismic events,[22] while supported by buoyant upwelling in the deeper mantle, some associate with an Azores hotspot.[23] Most of the volcanic activity has centered, primarily, along the Terceira Rift. From the beginning of the island's settlement, around the 15th century, there have been 28 registered volcanic eruptions (15 terrestrial and 13 submarine). The last significant volcanic eruption, the Capelinhos volcano (Vulcão dos Capelinhos), occurred off the coast of the island of Faial in 1957; the most recent volcanic activity occurred in the seamounts and submarine volcanoes off the coast of Serreta and in the Pico-São Jorge Channel.[24] The islands have many examples of volcano-built geomorphology including many of the caves and subterranean lava tubes (such as the Gruta das Torres, Algar do Carvão, Gruta do Natal, Gruta das Cinco Ribeiras), the coastal lava fields (like the coast of Feteiras, Faial, the Mistério of Prainha or São João on Pico Island) in addition to the currently inactive cones in central São Miguel Island, the aforementioned Capelinhos on Faial, the volcanic complexes of Terceira or Plinian caldeira of Corvo Island.The islands of the archipelago were formed through volcanic and seismic activity during the Neogene Period; the first embryonic surfaces started to appear in the waters of Santa Maria during the Miocene epoch (from circa 8 million years ago). The sequence of the island formation has been generally characterized as: Santa Maria (8.12 Ma), São Miguel (4.1 Ma), Terceira (3.52 Ma), Graciosa (2.5 Ma), Flores (2.16 Ma), Faial (0.7 Ma), São Jorge (0.55 Ma), Corvo (0.7 Ma) and the youngest, Pico (0.27 Ma).[25] Although all islands have experienced volcanism during their geological history, within recorded \"human settlement\" history the islands of Santa Maria, Flores, Corvo and Graciosa have not experienced any volcanic eruptions; in addition to active fumaroles and hot-springs, the remaining islands have had sporadic eruptions since the 14th century. Apart from the Capelinhos volcano in 1957–58, the last recorded instance of \"island formation\" occurred off the coast of São Miguel, when the island of Sabrina was briefly formed.Owing to its geodynamic environment, the region has been center of intense seismic activity, particularly along its tectonic boundaries on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Terceira Rift. Seismic events although frequent, usually tectonic or vulco-tectonic in nature, but in general low to medium intensities, occasionally punctuated by events of level 5 or greater on the Richter scale.[26][27] The most severe earthquake was registered in 1757, near Calheta on the island of São Jorge, which exceeded 7 on the Richter scale. In comparison, the 1522 earthquake, mentioned by Gaspar Frutuoso the historian, was only a magnitude 6.8, but a level 10 on the Mercalli scale,[28] but responsible for the destruction of Vila Franca do Campo and landslides that may have killed less than 5000 of the inhabitants.The nine islands that comprise the archipelago occupy a surface area of 2,346 km2 (906 sq mi), that includes both the main islands and many islets located in their vicinities. Each of the islands have their own distinct geomorphological characteristics that make them unique: Corvo (the smallest island) is a crater of a major Plinian eruption; Flores (its neighbor on the North American Plate) is a rugged island carved by many valleys and escarpments; Faial characterized for its shield volcano and caldera (Cabeço Gordo); Pico, is the highest point, at 2,351 meters (7,713 ft), in the Azores and continental Portugal; Graciosa is known for its active Furnas do Enxofre and mixture of volcanic cones and plains; São Jorge is a long slender island, formed from fissural eruptions over thousands of years; Terceira, almost circular, is the location of one of the largest craters in the region; São Miguel is the largest island, and is pitted with many large craters and fields of spatter cones; and Santa Maria, the oldest island, is heavily eroded, being one of the few places to encounter brown sandy beaches in the archipelago. They range in surface area from the largest, São Miguel, at 759 km2 (293 sq mi) to the smallest, Corvo, at approximately 17 km2 (7 sq mi).These islands have naturally evolved into three recognizable groups located within the Azores Platform and they are:In addition, several sub-surface reefs (particularly the Dollabarat on the fringe of the Formigas), banks (specifically the Princess Alice Bank and D. João de Castro Bank, as well as many hydrothermal vents and sea-mounts are monitored by the regional authorities, owing to the complex geotectonic and socioeconomic significance within the economic exclusion zone of the archipelago.The archipelago lies in the Palearctic ecozone, forming a unique biome that includes the macaronesian subtropical laurissilva, with many endemic species of plants. Even though the Azores look very green and sometimes wild, the vegetation has been extremely altered. Approximately 95% of laurisilva has been wiped out in the past 600 years for its valuable wood (for tools, buildings, boats, fire wood, and so on) and to clear land for agriculture. As a result, it is estimated that more than half of insects on the islands have disappeared or will become extinct.[29] Many cultivated places (which are traditionally dedicated to pasture or to growing colocasia, potatoes, maize and other crops) have now been abandoned, especially as a result of emigration. Consequently, some invasive plants have filled these deserted and disturbed lands. The two most common of these alien species are Pittosporum undulatum and Acacia melanoxylon. They are usually restricted to ancient agricultural land and only rarely penetrate into undisturbed native vegetation. The main loss is in the lowlands (below 400 metres) where virtually all laurisilva was eradicated.A few Persea indica and Picconia azorica survive in some places, but appear extremely vulnerable. Only Myrica faya seems to have survived human impact quite well, and it is commonly found in hedges or among exotic trees. More recent introductions could become a serious threat, like Leptospermum scoparium, which has the ability to colonize the still nearly untouched medium-altitude vegetation (Ilex, Myrsine africana, Erica, and so on).Hydrangeas are another potential pest, but their threat is less serious. Notwithstanding the fact that Hydrangeas were introduced from America or Asia, some locals consider them a symbol of the archipelago, and propagate them along roadsides, helping them to escape into the wild. Cryptomeria, the Japanese cedar, is a conifer extensively grown for its timber; many seedlings can be found in the last remnants of medium-altitude native vegetation.The Azores has two endemic bird species. The Azores bullfinch, or Priolo, is restricted to remnant laurisilva forest in the mountains at the eastern end of São Miguel and is classified by BirdLife International as endangered. Monteiro's storm-petrel, described to science as recently as 2008, is known to breed in just two locations in the islands, but may occur more widely. An extinct species of owl, the São Miguel scops owl, has also recently been described, which probably became extinct after human settlement due to habitat destruction and the introduction of alien species.[30] The Azores also has an endemic bat, the Azores noctule, which is unusual in regularly feeding during the day.The islets of the Formigas (the Portuguese word for \"ants\"), including the area known as the Dollabarat Reef, has a rich environment of maritime species, such as black coral and manta rays, sharks, and sea turtles. On São Miguel there are notable micro-habitats formed by hot springs that host extremophile microorganisms.[31]The archipelago is spread out in the area between 37° N and the parallels of latitude that pass through the Lisbon area (38° 43' / 38° 55' N), giving it generally a tepid, oceanic, subtropical climate, with mild annual oscillations. Daily maximum temperatures usually range between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F). The average annual rainfall increases from east to west, and it ranges from 700 to 1600 annual millimetres (27.6–63 in) on average, reaching 6,300 millimetres (250 in) on Mount Pico,[32] the highest Portuguese mountain at 2,351 m (7,713 ft). The Azores High, an area of high atmospheric pressure, is named after the islands. Under the Köppen climate classification, the local climate is \"dry-summer subtropical\", often referred to as \"Mediterranean\". The Köppen subtype for this climate is \"Csb\".[33]In addition, the Instituto de Meteorologia has identified the following weather extremes:A total of 11 tropical or subtropical cyclones have affected the region in history. Most of them were either extratropical or tropical storms when they impacted the region, although several Category 1 hurricanes have reached the Azores. The following storms have impacted the region while at Category 1 strength: Hurricane Fran in 1973, Hurricane Emmy in 1976, Hurricane Gordon in 2006 and Hurricane Gordon in 2012. Several tropical storms have hit the region, including Tropical Storm Irma in 1978, Hurricane Bonnie in 1992 and Hurricane Erika in 1997. Storms that were extratropical when they impacted the region include Hurricane Tanya in 1995, Tropical Storm Ana in 2003 and Tropical Storm Grace in 2009. In addition, the 2005 Azores subtropical storm impacted the region in October 2005.The Azores are divided into 19 municipalities (concelhos); each municipality is further divided into parishes (freguesias), of which there is a total of 156 in all of the Azores. The municipalities, by island, are:There are six cities (Portuguese: cidades) in the Azores: Ponta Delgada, Lagoa and Ribeira Grande on the island of São Miguel; Angra do Heroísmo and Praia da Vitória on the island of Terceira, and Horta on Faial. Three of these, Ponta Delgada, Angra and Horta are considered capital/administrative cities to the regional government: homes to the President (Ponta Delgada), the Judiciary (Angra) and the Regional Assembly (Horta). Angra also serves as the ecclesiastical centre of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Angra, the episcopal see of the Azores.According to the 2011 Census, population in the Azores was 246,746 at a density of 106 inhabitants per square kilometre (270/sq mi).The Azores were uninhabited when Portuguese navigators arrived in the early 15th century; the settlement process was initiated in 1439 with individuals from various regions of mainland Portugal and from Madeira. The islands were populated mainly by Portuguese descendants immigrants from Algarve, Alentejo, and Minho; however, in an effort to escape the pressures of the Portuguese inquisition, many Portuguese Sephardic Jews, also known as the 'New Christians', (those who were forced to convert to Christianity during the Portuguese inquisition), settled on the island in large numbers. Azorean Jews had surnames such as: Rodrigues, Oliveira, Pereira, Pimentel, Cardozo, Teixeira, etc. The island was also settled by Moorish prisoners, African slaves from Guinea, Cape Verde and São Tomé, Flemish, French and Spaniards also contributed to the initial settlement. Thus the Azorean population received a significant contribution from people with genetic backgrounds other than Portuguese.The nature of the economy dictated that African slavery never became common in the Azores because they were sent to Brazil and the Caribbean. Only a few remained in the Azores to help with domestic chores, although the islands sometimes served as a waypoint for ships carrying African slaves.[37]Genetic studies (Pacheco et al., 2005; Branco et al., 2006; Branco et al., 2008a, 2008b, 2008c) report some genetic variability and heterogeneity in the Azorean population. As in continental Portugal, the most frequent mtDNA haplogroup in the Azores is H (45.2%). After R, Haplogroup J is the second most frequent Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup in the Azores. Y-chromosome Haplogroup J, found in greatest concentration in Southwest Asia, is thought to have originated in the Middle East. Data show that in the Azores this haplogroup is the second most common, with a frequency of 13.4%, twice as high as in mainland Portugal (6.8%; Rosser et al. 2000). The non-European haplogroup E3a, which is prevalent in North Africa, has also been found in the Azores.Azores Genetic Profile: Mtdna profile: Haplogroup H= 45.2% (Europe); Haplogroup K= 6.5% (Europe); Haplogroup L= 3.4% (Africa); Haplogroup T= 10.1% (Spain, Portugal); Haplogroup U= 16.7% (Europe, North Africa).Y-chromosome DNA profile: Haplogroup E1b1b= 9% (North Africa, Europe, Spain; the Balkans); Haplogroup E-V38= (West Africa, Central Africa, Southeast Africa); Haplogroup G= (Europe, Asia, Africa, Middle East, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia); Haplogroup I= 5% (Europe, Near East, Caucasus, Central Asia; Bosnia, Herzegovina, Croatia); Haplogroup I1b = 30.8% (Europe); Haplogroup I1c =  ?% (?); Haplogroup J= 13% (southwestern Arabian Peninsula, north Africa, southern Europe); Haplogroup N3= (Europe); Haplogroup R1b= 61.5% (Western Europe); Haplogroup R1b3= 60% (European: Spanish, Catalans, Portuguese, Occitans, French).Since the 17th century, many Azoreans have emigrated, mainly to Brazil, Uruguay, the United States and Canada.[38] Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts, especially the cities of New Bedford, Bristol, Barrington, Pawtucket, Central Falls, West Warwick, Hudson, Marlborough, East Providence, River Point, Taunton and Fall River have been, and remain, the primary destination for Azorean emigrants.[39] Northern California was the final destination for many of the Massachusetts immigrants who then moved on to the San Joaquin Valley, especially the city of Turlock, just south of Modesto. In the late 1800s many Azoreans emigrated to the Hawaiian islands. The tuna fishing industry drew a significant number of Azoreans to the Point Loma neighborhood of San Diego, in Southern California.[40] From 1921 to 1977, about 250,000 Azoreans immigrated to Rhode Island and Massachusetts.[41]Many Azoreans also moved to Bermuda and Hawaii.[42] Florianópolis and Porto Alegre in the Southern Region of Brazil were founded by Azoreans, who accounted for over half of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina's population in the late 18th century.[43] As late as 1960 mass immigration currents were registered to Brazil, and many were from the Azores.[42]Politically, since 1976, the Azores is an autonomous region integrated within the framework of the Portuguese Republic. It has its own government and autonomous legislature within its own political-administrative statute and organic law. Its governmental organs include: the Legislative Assembly, a unicameral parliament composed of 52 elected deputies, elected by universal suffrage for a four-year term; the Regional Government and Presidency, with parliamentary legitimacy, composed of a President, a Vice-President and seven Regional Secretaries responsible for day-to-day operations. It is represented in the Council of Ministers by a representative appointed by the President of the Republic, which was created during the revision of the constitution of 2004 (which, among other things, removed the older Portuguese representative that was appointed by the President of the Republic, beholden to the Council of State and coincident with the President).Since becoming a Portuguese autonomous region, the executive branch of the regional authority has been located in Ponta Delgada, the legislative branch in Horta, and the judicial branch in Angra do Heroísmo.The islands of the archipelago do not have independent status in law, except in electoral law and are governed by 19 municipalities that subdivide the islands. In addition, until the administrative reform of the 19th century, the following civil parishes had municipal standing: Topo (today integrated into the municipality of Calheta, São Jorge); Praia (today integrated into municipality of Santa Cruz da Graciosa); São Sebastião (today an integral part of the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo); Capelas (now part of the municipality of Ponta Delgada); and Água de Pau (now a civil parish in the municipality of Lagoa). These civil parishes still retain their titles of \"vila\" in name only, by Regional Legislative Decree nº 29/2003/A, 24 June 2003; the populations of Capelas and neighbouring parish still protest the change and promote the restoration of their status. The municipalities are also subdivided into several civil parishes, with the exception of Corvo (the only municipality by law without a civil parish, owing to its size).Azorean politics are dominated by the two largest Portuguese political parties, the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Socialist Party (PS), the latter holding a majority in the Regional Legislative Assembly. The Democratic and Social Center / People's Party (CDS/PP), the Left Bloc (BE), the Unitarian Democratic Coalition (CDU) and the People's Monarchist Party (PPM) are also represented in the local parliament. Currently, as of the 2008 Regional Elections[update], the Socialist Party (PS) and its leader, Carlos César have a plurality of the seats in the Assembly, and operate the Regional Government. Although the PS dominates the regional politics, the PSD is traditionally popular in city and town council elections.In 2003, the Azores saw international attention when United States President George W. Bush, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar, and Portuguese Prime Minister José Manuel Durão Barroso held a summit there days before the commencement of the Iraq War.[44]Each of the nine islands has an airfield,[45] although the majority are aerodromes rather than airports. The commercial terminals in Ponta Delgada, Horta, Vila do Porto and Santa Cruz das Flores are operated by ANA – Aeroportos de Portugal, a public entity that oversees the operations of airports across Portugal. The remaining, except for Lajes Field, are operated by the Regional Government. Lajes is a military airbase, as well as a commercial airport, and is operated by the Portuguese Armed Forces in conjunction with the United States.The airports are:The Azores has had a long history of water transport to overcome distances and establish inter-community contacts and trade. Consequently, the shipbuilding industry developed in many islands, from small fishing boats, to whaling sloops to larger passenger services.[46] Passenger traffic to the main islands (São Miguel, Santa Maria, Terceira and Faial) began in the 17th century, and between the 18th–19th century, the Pico Yacht controlled the lucrative summer traffic season.[46]After 1871, the Insulana Shipping Company was the only entity responsible for regular traffic between the islands (except Corvo), Madeira and the United States.[46] Yet, cargo and passenger transportation ceased in the 1970s, and the ships were sold or converted into tuna fishing boats. For the next 20 years, commercial maritime service between the islands ceased (except between Faial-Pico and Lajes das Flores-Vila do Corvo).[46]Transmaçor (Transportes Marítimos Açorianos, Lda.) was founded on 22 December 1987, resulting from the fusion of Empresa das Lanchas do Pico, Ld, owners of the ships Espalamaca and Calheta (ships that had travelled the canal between Faial and Pico for several years); Empresa Açoreana de Transportes Marítimos, Lda, which operated the ship Terra Alta; and Transcanal (Transportes Marítimos do Canal, Lda.) operator the traditional boats Picaroto and Manuel José.[47][48] In the Central Group, the shipping company operates four to six time daily connections between Horta and Madalena throughout the year, using its small fleet of ships (Cruzeiro das Ilhas, Cruzeiro do Canal, Expresso das Ilhas and Expresso do Triângulo), in addition to inter-island connections between Faial, Pico, São Jorge and Terceira during the summer months.[47]Meanwhile, new initiatives began in the late 1990s: the catamaran Iapetos began services, followed by Lady of Mann and Golfinho Azul (chartered by Açorline).[46] In 2005, Atlanticoline was established, providing services with the ships Ilha Azul and Express Santorini, later adding the Viking in 2009.[46] In 2009, Atlanticoline was involved in a controversial rejection of a 750 passenger, 150 vehicle ship ordered from the Estaleiros de Viana do Castelo (Viana do Castelo Shipyards).[49] The Atlantida, a 50 million Euro cruiser (as part of a two-ship deal with the other named Anticiclone) was rejected in 2009 by Atlanticoline for the under-performance of the power-plant.[49] Although it would only result in a five-minute delay between islands, the public company rejected the ship, and the contract was broken over the builder's inability to deliver the required ship on time.[49] While, the ship was being shopped to other interested parties (Hugo Chávez once considered purchasing the ferryboat in 2010), no interested buyers appeared, and ENVC decided to cede the Atlantida to Atlânticoline as part of the latter's open international competition to charter two ships in 2012.[49]On 20 June 2011, the Regional Government announced that it would purchase 60% of Transmaçor, equivalent to 500,000 Euro of the company's capital.[50] With this acquisition the Autonomous government of the Azores controlled 88% of the capital, with 12% to shareholders.[50] The signed memorandum of understanding concluded negotiations between the various parties involved, under which the liability of Transmaçor (worth a total of 8 million Euro) was divided equally between the Region and businessman José Almeida, who is the holder of a majority stake in the company.[50]Similarly, the Regional Government approved the consolidation of the three individual port authorities (Administração dos Portos do Triângulo e Grupo Ocidental, Administração dos Portos da Terceira e Graciosa and the Administração dos Portos das Ilhas de São Miguel e Santa Maria) and regional Portos dos Açores into one entity that resulted in a 2.2 million Euro cost savings, in addition to a reduction from 11 to three administrators.[51]Azoreans have developed their own distinct regional identity and cultural traits, from a combination of continental Portuguese customs brought by various waves of immigration and local political and environmental factors.Religious festivals, patron saints and traditional holidays mark the Azorean calendar. The most important religious events are tied with the festivals associated with the cult of the Holy Spirit, commonly referred to as the festivals of the Holy Spirit (or Espírito Santo), rooted in millenarian dogma and held on all islands from May to September. These festivals are very important to the Azorean people, who are primarily Roman Catholic, and combine religious rituals with processions celebrating the benevolence and egalitarianism of neighbours. These events are centred around treatros or impérios, small buildings that host the meals, adoration and charity of the participants, and used to store the artefacts associated with the events. On Terceira, for example, these impérios have grown into ornate buildings painted and cared for by the local brotherhoods in their respective parishes. The events focus on the members of local parishes, not tourists, but all are welcome, as sharing is one of the main principles of the festivals. Some limited events focus on tourists, including a public event that the city government of Ponta Delgada on the island of São Miguel holds, which attracts visitors and locals.Another event, the Festival of the Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles (or Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres) in Ponta Delgada on the island of São Miguel, is the largest individual religious event in the Azores, and takes place on the fifth Sunday after Easter. Pilgrims from within the Portuguese diaspora normally travel to Ponta Delgada to participate in an afternoon procession behind the image of Christ along the flower-decorated streets of the city. Although the solemn procession is only held on one day, the events of the Festival of Senhor Santo Cristo occur over a period of a week and involve a ritual of moving the image between the main church and convent nightly, ultimately culminating in the procession, which is televised within the Azores and to the Portuguese diaspora. The Sanjoaninas Festivities in Angra do Heroísmo on Terceira are held in June honoring Saint Anthony, Saint Peter and Saint John the Baptist, in a large religious celebration.The festival of Our Lady of Lourdes (or Nossa Senhora de Lourdes), patron saint of whalers, begins in Lajes on Pico Island on the last Sunday of August and runs through the week—Whalers Week. It is marked by social and cultural events connected to the tradition of whale hunting. The Wine Harvest Festival (or Festa das Vindimas), takes place during the first week of September and is a century-old custom of the people of Pico.On Corvo the people celebrate their patron saint Nossa Senhora dos Milagres (Our Lady of Miracles) on 15 August every year in addition to the festivals of the Divine Holy Spirit. The Festival da Maré de Agosto (August Sea Festival), takes place every year beginning on 15 August in Praia Formosa on Santa Maria. Also, the Semana do Mar (Sea Week), dedicated almost exclusively to water sports, takes place in August in the city of Horta, on Faial.Carnaval is also celebrated in the Azores. Parades and pageants are the heart of the Carnaval festivities. There is lively music, colorful costumes, hand-made masks, and floats. The traditional bullfights in the bullring are ongoing as is the running of bulls in the streets.15th century16th century15th century16th century17th century18th century19th century16th century17th

sort.","path":[85800,5.316442,60.39725,84600,5.316437,60.39725,83160,5.316448,60.39725,81720,5.316448,60.39725,80340,5.316443,60.39725,79140,5.316447,60.39725,77940,5.316443,60.39725,76740,5.3165,60.39717,75300,5.316433,60.39726,73920,5.316445,60.39725,72720,5.316443,60.39726,71520,5.3165,60.39734,70320,5.316438,60.39725,68880,5.316442,60.39725,67440,5.3165,60.39734,66060,5.316438,60.39725,64620,5.316437,60.39725,63180,5.316447,60.39725,61740,5.316425,60.39724,60300,5.316401,60.39723,58920,5.316433,60.39724,57660,5.316432,60.39724,56280,5.316333,60.39717,55020,5.316435,60.39726,53580,5.316667,60.39734,53340,5.316662,60.39787,53160,5.313988,60.39941,52980,5.305799,60.40217,52800,5.300883,60.40671,52620,5.292498,60.41489,52440,5.283013,60.42242,52320,5.275617,60.42767,52200,5.268838,60.4325,52080,5.262333,60.43867,51900,5.257283,60.44451,51720,5.2505,60.45333,51540,5.247,60.4625,51420,5.243378,60.46879,51300,5.23842,60.47535,51180,5.234167,60.481,51060,5.229858,60.48652,50940,5.224667,60.492,50820,5.218833,60.49683,50700,5.208833,60.50033,50580,5.198667,60.50367,50400,5.186833,60.5075,50280,5.175125,60.51137,50160,5.164962,60.51469,50040,5.154812,60.51796,49920,5.143645,60.52024,49800,5.132208,60.52228,49680,5.119522,60.52453,49560,5.106845,60.52682,49380,5.094,60.529,49260,5.0795,60.53133,49140,5.066,60.53367,48900,5.04612,60.53705,48780,5.034,60.54067,48660,5.023667,60.54367,48480,5.011378,60.54701,48300,4.994897,60.55243,48120,4.984395,60.5591,47820,4.99002,60.57367,47700,4.987833,60.58083,47280,4.964872,60.59665,47040,4.949214,60.60349,46560,4.925667,60.62366,46380,4.9165,60.63167,46200,4.906915,60.6394,46080,4.900417,60.64428,45960,4.894072,60.64923,45840,4.887667,60.65467,45720,4.882,60.65983,45480,4.873,60.66883,45300,4.86939,60.67663,45180,4.864167,60.68333,45000,4.857333,60.68942,44880,4.850358,60.6957,44700,4.843487,60.70197,44340,4.825518,60.71926,44220,4.820378,60.72425,44100,4.815175,60.72923,43980,4.80984,60.73423,43860,4.805,60.73867,43680,4.796945,60.74616,43560,4.791265,60.75115,43440,4.786,60.75633,43320,4.780667,60.76133,43200,4.775333,60.76633,43080,4.770167,60.7715,42960,4.764833,60.77667,42780,4.758616,60.78276,42600,4.750428,60.79043,42420,4.744075,60.79883,42240,4.740372,60.80704,42060,4.736585,60.81516,41880,4.741638,60.82298,41700,4.754403,60.82823,41520,4.770495,60.83125,41340,4.786833,60.83433,41160,4.802643,60.83775,40980,4.819334,60.83933,40860,4.831403,60.83955,40740,4.842258,60.84087,40620,4.853853,60.84241,40500,4.864342,60.84409,40380,4.875235,60.8449,40260,4.887263,60.84556,40140,4.898573,60.84593,40020,4.909878,60.8465,39900,4.921273,60.84715,39720,4.933545,60.84823,39540,4.941252,60.85551,39360,4.944815,60.86513,39180,4.949292,60.87344,39000,4.959333,60.88083,38880,4.964788,60.88641,38760,4.962515,60.89207,38640,4.959683,60.89766,38520,4.959208,60.90356,38400,4.959084,60.90924,38280,4.959637,60.91498,38160,4.957175,60.92048,38040,4.953945,60.92591,37920,4.95035,60.93133,37800,4.946058,60.93722,37680,4.941617,60.94263,37560,4.936,60.948,37440,4.930833,60.95333,37320,4.927667,60.959,37140,4.925807,60.9652,36960,4.92291,60.97385,36780,4.920323,60.98251,36600,4.917333,60.991,36420,4.912378,60.99991,36300,4.914667,61.00633,36120,4.923207,61.01245,35940,4.932953,61.01929,35820,4.941482,61.02529,35580,4.951167,61.03333,35400,4.959607,61.0406,29820,4.919322,61.27261,25860,4.979965,61.40541,25740,4.970987,61.4108,25620,4.968415,61.41631,25440,4.96991,61.42303,25320,4.971667,61.42967,25200,4.973358,61.43569,24960,4.976053,61.44549,24780,4.977918,61.45407,24600,4.979167,61.46217,24420,4.98,61.4705,24240,4.982703,61.47893,24120,4.98438,61.48504,24000,4.983587,61.49081,23820,4.9865,61.49833,23640,4.995177,61.50607,23520,5.000689,61.51277,23400,5.001453,61.51853,23280,5.002192,61.52439,23040,5.002887,61.5337,22860,5.002867,61.54237,22680,5.002614,61.55086,22560,4.992833,61.55667,22440,4.983723,61.56114,22320,4.975295,61.56534,22200,4.966952,61.56953,22080,4.958758,61.57365,21960,4.953136,61.57862,21840,4.952867,61.58433,21720,4.955025,61.58987,21600,4.959368,61.59521,21480,4.958927,61.60065,21360,4.95315,61.60581,21240,4.944835,61.61015,21120,4.936202,61.61428,21000,4.927487,61.61836,20880,4.918167,61.62217,20760,4.909,61.626,20640,4.899735,61.62995,20520,4.890522,61.63384,20400,4.881183,61.63772,20280,4.871668,61.64167,20100,4.861603,61.64595,19920,4.848173,61.65209,19740,4.836333,61.659,19560,4.8255,61.66617,19380,4.8155,61.67333,19200,4.805333,61.68033,19020,4.795166,61.687,18840,4.781167,61.69316,18720,4.770167,61.69633,18600,4.7595,61.699,18480,4.749,61.70183,18360,4.738435,61.70485,18240,4.728063,61.70781,18120,4.717777,61.71077,18000,4.7085,61.7145,17880,4.699167,61.71817,17760,4.689833,61.72167,17640,4.680666,61.72533,17520,4.670846,61.72928,17400,4.661677,61.73293,17280,4.651659,61.73687,17160,4.642408,61.74043,17040,4.632962,61.74399,16920,4.623167,61.748,16740,4.618333,61.7535,16560,4.612333,61.76183,16380,4.611657,61.77102,16200,4.61184,61.77962,16020,4.612293,61.78825,15840

is Odin's son is clearly mentioned only here and in some versions of a list of the sons of Odin (see Sons of Odin). But \"wish-son\" in stanza 16 of the Lokasenna could mean \"Odin's son\" and is translated by Hollander as Odin's kin. Bragi's mother is never named. If Bragi's mother is Frigg, then Frigg is somewhat dismissive of Bragi in the Lokasenna in stanza 27 when Frigg complains that if she had a son in Ægir's hall as brave as Baldr then Loki would have to fight for his life.\n\nIn that poem Bragi at first forbids Loki to enter the hall but is overruled by Odin. Loki then gives a greeting to all gods and goddesses who are in the hall save to Bragi. Bragi generously offers his sword, horse, and an arm ring as peace gift but Loki only responds by accusing Bragi of cowardice, of being the most afraid to fight of any of the Æsir and Elves within the hall. Bragi responds that if they were outside the hall, he would have Loki's head, but Loki only repeats the accusation. When Bragi's wife Iðunn attempts to calm Bragi, Loki accuses her of embracing her brother's slayer, a reference to matters that have not survived. It may be that Bragi had slain Iðunn's brother.\n\nA passage in the Poetic Edda poem Sigrdrífumál describes runes being graven on the sun, on the ear of one of the sun-horses and on the hoofs of the other, on Sleipnir's teeth, on bear's paw, on eagle's beak, on wolf's claw, and on several other things including on Bragi's tongue. Then the runes are shaved off and the shavings are mixed with mead and sent abroad so that Æsir have some, Elves have some, Vanir have some, and Men have some, these being beech runes and birth runes, ale runes, and magic runes. The meaning of this is obscure.","path":[85080,7.104715,61.2296,83640,7.104667,61.22955,82200,7.10472,61.2296,80760,7.104758,61.22959,79320,7.104695,61.2296,77880,7.104727,61.22961,76440,7.104737,61.2296,75000,7.104712,61.22959,73560,7.10476,61.22961,72120,7.104718,61.22958,70680,7.104757,61.2296,69240,7.105403,61.22969,69120,7.108508,61.22623,68940,7.10398,61.21382,68760,7.061913,61.19707,68580,7.023702,61.17772,65760,6.575181,61.11603,65640,6.580768,61.09628,65460,6.580197,61.0891,65220,6.578038,61.09737,65040,6.534152,61.10709,64860,6.479208,61.10745,64680,6.42397,61.10782,64560,6.377485,61.10885,64440,6.341473,61.11252,64320,6.306502,61.11672,64200,6.271393,61.12093,64080,6.235825,61.12523,63960,6.20071,61.12884,63840,6.164102,61.13213,63720,6.12919,61.13583,63480,6.076602,61.14158,63300,6.027595,61.15147,63180,5.99405,61.16659,63060,5.98691,61.17343,62820,5.957797,61.16097,62640,5.909039,61.15199,62520,5.87447,61.14703,62400,5.840587,61.14276,62220,5.793145,61.13701,62100,5.751733,61.1317,58200,5.037477,60.97621,57960,4.989968,60.96428,57720,4.95249,60.94448,57300,4.953098,60.93311,57120,4.958465,60.90818,57000,4.962081,60.89151,56880,4.96005,60.87517,56760,4.95713,60.85889,56640,4.954437,60.84266,56520,4.949633,60.8265,56400,4.944635,60.81013,56280,4.960886,60.79655,56160,4.98891,60.7865,56040,5.011167,60.77449,55920,5.03439,60.76229,55800,5.025558,60.74953,55680,5.036603,60.73434,55560,5.047603,60.71871,55440,5.06561,60.70501,55320,5.090875,60.69422,55200,5.11205,60.68173,55080,5.112878,60.66858,54960,5.11302,60.66364,54840,5.114478,60.65771,54720,5.133515,60.64623,54540,5.169477,60.63105,54420,5.190505,60.61794,54300,5.206148,60.60322,54180,5.223663,60.58882,54060,5.228475,60.57773,53940,5.229613,60.57234,53820,5.23106,60.56419,53700,5.255263,60.55279,53580,5.275052,60.53933,53460,5.273278,60.52297,53340,5.26145,60.50761,53220,5.255293,60.49091,52980,5.26117,60.46447,52800,5.273248,60.44055,52620,5.292237,60.41777,52440,5.310567,60.40089,52260,5.320647,60.39661,52140,5.322977,60.39499,51420,5.322958,60.39505,49980,5.322807,60.39511,48780,5.322917,60.39513,47520,5.322866,60.395,46260,5.322854,60.39503,45000,5.322868,60.39503,43740,5.32294,60.39503,42480,5.32287,60.39505,41220,5.322915,60.39495,39960,5.322827,60.39511,38700,5.322987,60.39507,37440,5.322807,60.39509,36180,5.322845,60.39504,35880,5.322018,60.3957,35700,5.313265,60.39986,35580,5.302727,60.40512,35460,5.288937,60.4202,35340,5.274537,60.43826,35160,5.263186,60.45535,34980,5.252553,60.47971,34800,5.258665,60.50423,34620,5.275617,60.52738,34440,5.258447,60.55157,34260,5.230058,60.56833,34080,5.228835,60.57701,33960,5.22353,60.58437,33840,5.215028,60.59553,33720,5.199125,60.60987,33720,5.199125,60.60987,33600,5.179377,60.62468,33360,5.135288,60.64543,33180,5.112952,60.66011,33000,5.113283,60.66916,32880,5.106058,60.68621,32760,5.08692,60.69612,32640,5.060017,60.70755,32520,5.045385,60.72202,32400,5.033728,60.73871,32220,5.034472,60.7536,32040,5.012563,60.77371,31800,4.965017,60.79516,31620,4.945075,60.81583,31440,4.953572,60.84376,31320,4.957135,60.86131,31200,4.960878,60.87734,31020,4.961578,60.89607,30840,4.956821,60.91935,30600,4.953257,60.94389,30360,4.94317,60.94592,29880,5.00074,60.97173,29340,5.022915,61.00611,25920,5.67991,61.12058,25800,5.71324,61.12539,25620,5.74997,61.13065,25500,5.792173,61.13675,25380,5.82614,61.14203,25260,5.860513,61.14723,25140,5.895047,61.15233,25020,5.92919,61.15707,24900,5.962447,61.16192,24780,5.986448,61.17213,24480,6.001583,61.16294,24300,6.046423,61.14584,24180,6.083153,61.14042,24060,6.117933,61.13639,23940,6.15307,61.13277,23760,6.204967,61.12716,23640,6.23989,61.12343,23520,6.274672,61.11959,23400,6.309351,61.1158,23280,6.350081,61.11133,23160,6.384565,61.1077,22740,6.500287,61.10643,22500,6.570213,61.10277,22380,6.579763,61.09069,22080,6.578805,61.09456,21900,6.568835,61.12254,18660,7.0742,61.20059,18480,7.111882,61.21845,18300,7.104856,61.22911,17160,7.104685,61.22959,15900,7.104648,61.22958,14640,7.10475,61.22959,13380,7.104738,61.2296,11760,7.104723,61.22958,10500,7.10472,61.22958,9240,7.10472,61.22953,7800,7.104678,61.22961,6540,7.104695,61.2296,5280,7.104697,61.22958,4020,7.104772,61.22957,2760,7.104733,61.22956,1320,7.104737,61.2296,60,7.104715,61.2296]},{"name":"NJORD","text":"NJORD:In Norse Paganism, Njörðr is a god among the Vanir. Njörðr, father of the deities Freyr and Freyja by his unnamed Vanir sister, was in an ill-fated marriage with the goddess Skaði, lives in Nóatún and is associated with sea, seafaring, wind, fishing, wealth, and crop fertility.Njörðr is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, in euhemerized form as a beloved mythological early king of Sweden in Heimskringla, also written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, as one of three gods invoked in the 14th century Hauksbók ring oath, and in numerous Scandinavian place names. Veneration of Njörðr survived into 18th or 19th century Norwegian folk practice, where the god is recorded as Njor and thanked for a bountiful catch of fish.Njörðr has been the subject of an amount of scholarly discourse and theory, often connecting him with the figure of the much earlier attested Germanic goddess Nerthus, the hero Hadingus, and theorizing on his formerly more prominent place in Norse paganism due to the appearance of his name in numerous place names. Njörðr is sometimes modernly anglicized as Njord, Njoerd, or Njorth.The name Njörðr corresponds to that of the older Germanic fertility goddess Nerthus, and both derive from the Proto-Germanic *Nerþuz. The original meaning of the name is contested, but it may be related to the Irish word nert which means \"force\" and \"power\". It has been suggested that the change of sex from the female Nerthus to the male Njörðr is due to the fact that feminine nouns with u-stems disappeared early in Germanic language while the masculine nouns with u-stems prevailed. However, other scholars hold the change to be based not on grammatical gender but on the evolution of religious beliefs; that *Nerþuz and Njörðr appear as different genders because they are to be considered separate beings.[1] The name Njörðr may be related to the name of the Norse goddess Njörun.[2]Njörðr's name appears in various place names in Scandinavia, such as Nærdhæwi (now Nalavi), Njærdhavi (now Mjärdevi), Nærdhælunda (now Närlunda), Nierdhatunum (now Närtuna) in Sweden,[1] Njarðvík in southwest Iceland, Njarðarlög and Njarðey (now Nærøy) in Norway.[3] Njörðr's name appears in a word for sponge; Njarðarvöttr (Old Norse \"Njörðr's glove\"). Additionally, in Old Icelandic translations of Classical mythology the Roman god Saturn's name is glossed as \"Njörðr.\"[4]Njörðr is attested in the following works:Njörðr is described as a future survivor of Ragnarök in stanza 39 of the poem Vafþrúðnismál. In the poem, the god Odin, disguised as \"Gagnráðr\" faces off with the wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir in a battle of wits. While Odin states that Vafþrúðnir knows all the fates of the gods, Odin asks Vafþrúðnir \"from where Njörðr came to the sons of the Æsir,\" that Njörðr rules over quite a lot of temples and hörgrs (a type of Germanic altar), and further adds that Njörðr was not raised among the Æsir. In response, Vafþrúðnir says:In stanza 16 of the poem Grímnismál, Njörðr is described as having a hall in Nóatún made for himself. The stanza describes Njörðr as a \"prince of men,\" that he is \"lacking in malice,\" and that he \"rules over the \"high-timbered temple.\"[6] In stanza 43, the creation of the god Freyr's ship Skíðblaðnir is recounted, and Freyr is cited as the son of Njörðr.[7] In the prose introduction to the poem Skírnismál, Freyr is mentioned as the son of Njörðr, and stanza 2 cites the goddess Skaði as the mother of Freyr.[8] Further in the poem, Njörðr is again mentioned as the father of Freyr in stanzas 38, 39, and 41.[9]In the late flyting poem Lokasenna, an exchange between Njörðr and Loki occurs in stanzas 33, 34, 35, and 36. After Loki has an exchange with the goddess Freyja, in stanza 33 Njörðr states:Loki responds in the stanza 34, stating that \"from here you were sent east as hostage to the gods\" (a reference to the Æsir-Vanir War) and that \"the daughters of Hymir used you as a pisspot, and pissed in your mouth.\"[10] In stanza 35, Njörðr responds that:Loki tells Njörðr to \"stop\" and \"keep some moderation,\" and that he \"won't keep it a secret any longer\" that Njörðr's son Freyr was produced with his unnamed sister, \"though you'd expect him to be worse than he is.\" The god Tyr then interjects and the flyting continues in turn.[10]Njörðr is referenced in stanza 22 of the poem Þrymskviða, where he is referred to as the father of the goddess Freyja. In the poem, the jötunn Þrymr mistakenly thinks that he will be receiving the goddess Freyja as his bride, and while telling his fellow jötunn to spread straw on the benches in preparation for the arrival of Freyja, he refers to her as the daughter of Njörðr of Nóatún.[11] Towards the end of the poem Sólarljóð, Njörðr is cited as having nine daughters. Two of the names of these daughters are given; the eldest Ráðveig and the youngest Kreppvör.[12]Njörðr is mentioned in the Prose Edda books Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál.In the Prose Edda, Njörðr is introduced in chapter 23 of the book Gylfaginning. In this chapter, Njörðr is described by the enthroned figure of High as living in the heavens at Nóatún, but also as ruling over the movement of the winds, having the ability to calm both sea and fire, and that he is to be invoked in seafaring and fishing. High continues that Njörðr is very wealthy and prosperous, and that he can also grant wealth in land and valuables to those who request his aid. Njörðr originates from Vanaheimr and is devoid of Æsir stock, and he is described as having been traded with Hœnir in hostage exchange with between the Æsir and Vanir.[13]High further states that Njörðr's wife is Skaði, that she is the daughter of the jötunn Þjazi, and recounts a tale involving the two. High recalls that Skaði wanted to live in the home once owned by her father called Þrymheimr (\"Thunder Home\"). However, Njörðr wanted to live nearer to the sea. Subsequently, the two made an agreement that they would spend nine nights in Þrymheimr and then next three nights in Nóatún (or nine winters in Þrymheimr and another nine in Nóatún according to the Codex Regius manuscript[14]). However, when Njörðr returned from the mountains to Nóatún, he says:Skaði then responds:High states that afterward Skaði went back up to the mountains to Þrymheimr and recites a stanza where Skaði skis around, hunts animals with a bow, and lives in her fathers old house.[14] Chapter 24 begins, which describes Njörðr as the father of two beautiful and powerful children: Freyr and Freyja.[15] In chapter 37, after Freyr has spotted the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, he becomes overcome with sorrow, and refuses to sleep, drink, or talk. Njörðr then sends for Skírnir to find out who he seems to be so angry at, and, not looking forward to being treated roughly, Skírnir reluctantly goes to Freyr.[16]Njörðr is introduced in Skáldskaparmál within a list of 12 Æsir attending a banquet held for Ægir.[17] Further in Skáldskaparmál, the skaldic god Bragi recounds the death of Skaði's father Þjazi by the Æsir. As one of the three acts of reparation performed by the Æsir for Þjazi's death, Skaði was allowed by the Æsir to choose a husband from amongst them, but given the stipulation that she may not see any part of them but their feet when making the selection. Expecting to choose the god Baldr by the beauty of the feet she selects, Skaði instead finds that she has picked Njörðr.[18]In chapter 6, a list of kennings is provided for Njörðr: \"God of chariots,\" \"Descendant of Vanir,\" \"a Van,\" father of Freyr and Freyja, and \"the giving god.\" This is followed by an excerpt from a composition by the 11th century skald Þórðr Sjáreksson, explained as containing a reference to Skaði leaving Njörðr:Chapter 7 follows and provides various kennings for Freyr, including referring to him as the son of Njörðr. This is followed by an excerpt from a work by the 10th century skald Egill Skallagrímsson that references Njörðr (here anglicized as \"Niord\"):In chapter 20, \"daughter of Njörðr\" is given as a kenning for Freyja.[19] In chapter 33, Njörðr is cited among the gods attending a banquet held by Ægir.[20] In chapter 37, Freyja is again referred to as Njörðr's daughter in a verse by the 12th century skald Einarr Skúlason.[21] In chapter 75, Njörðr is included in a list of the Æsir.[22] Additionally, Njörðr is used in kennings for \"warrior\" or \"warriors\" various times in Skáldskaparmál.[23]Njörðr appears in or is mentioned in three Kings' sagas collected in Heimskringla; Ynglinga saga, the Saga of Hákon the Good and the Saga of Harald Graycloak. In chapter 4 of Ynglinga saga, Njörðr is introduced in connection with the Æsir-Vanir War. When the two sides became tired of war, they came to a peace agreement and exchanged hostages. For their part, the Vanir send to the Æsir their most \"outstanding men\"; Njörðr, described as wealthy, and Freyr, described as his son, in exchange for the Æsir's Hœnir. Additionally, the Æsir send Mímir in exchange for the wise Kvasir.[24]Further into chapter 4, Odin appoints Njörðr and Freyr as priests of sacrificial offerings, and they became gods among the Æsir. Freyja is introduced as a daughter of Njörðr, and as the priestess at the sacrifices. In the saga, Njörðr is described as having once wed his unnamed sister while he was still among the Vanir, and the couple produced their children Freyr and Freyja from this union, though this custom was forbidden among the Æsir.[24]Chapter 5 relates that Odin gave all of his temple priests dwelling places and good estates, in Njörðr's case being Nóatún.[25] Chapter 8 states that Njörðr married a woman named Skaði, though she would not have intercourse with him. Skaði then marries Odin, and the two had numerous sons.[26]In chapter 9, Odin dies and Njörðr takes over as ruler of the Swedes, and he continues the sacrifices. The Swedes recognize him as their king, and pay him tribute. Njörðr's rule is marked with peace and many great crops, so much so that the Swedes believed that Njörðr held power over the crops and over the prosperity of mankind. During his rule, most of the Æsir die, their bodies are burned, and sacrifices are made by men to them. Njörðr has himself \"marked for\" Odin and he dies in his bed. Njörðr's body is burnt by the Swedes, and they weep heavily at his tomb. After Njörðr's reign, his son Freyr replaces him, and he is greatly loved and \"blessed by good seasons like his father.\"[27]In chapter 14 of Saga of Hákon the Good a description of the pagan Germanic custom of Yule is given. Part of the description includes a series of toasts. The toasts begin with Odin's toasts, described as for victory and power for the king, followed by Njörðr and Freyr's toast, intended for good harvests and peace. Following this, a beaker is drank for the king, and then a toast is given for departed kin.[28] Chapter 28 quotes verse where the kenning \"Njörðr-of-roller-horses\" is used for \"sailor\".[29] In the Saga of Harald Graycloak, a stanza is given of a poem entitled Vellekla (\"Lack of Gold\") by the 10th century Icelandic skald Einarr skálaglamm that mentions Njörðr in a kenning for \"warrior.\"[30]In chapter 80 of the 13th century Icelandic saga Egils saga, Egill Skallagrímsson composes a poem in praise of Arinbjörn (Arinbjarnarkviða). In stanza 17, Egill writes that all others watch in marvel how Arinbjörn gives out wealth, as he has been so endowed by the gods Freyr and Njörðr.[31]Veneration of Njörðr survived into 18th or 19th century Norwegian folk practice, as recorded in a tale collected by Halldar O. Opedal from an informant in Odda, Hordaland, Norway. The informant comments on a family tradition in which the god is thanked for a bountiful catch of fish:Scholar Georges Dumézil further cites various tales of havmennesker (Norwegian \"sea people\") who govern over sea weather, wealth, or, in some incidents, give magic boats are likely connected to Njörðr.[33]Njörðr is often identified with the goddess Nerthus, whose reverence by various Germanic tribes is described by Roman historian Tacitus in his 1st CE century work Germania. The connection between the two is due to the linguistic relationship between Njörðr and the reconstructed *Nerþuz,[34] \"Nerthus\" being the feminine, Latinized form of what Njörðr would have looked like around 1 CE.[35] This has led to theories about the relation of the two, including that Njörðr may have once been a hermaphroditic god or, generally considered more likely, that the name may indicate an otherwise unattested divine brother and sister pair such as Freyr and Freyja.[34] Consequently, Nerthus has been identified with Njörðr's unnamed sister with whom he had Freyja and Freyr, which is mentioned in Lokasenna.[36]In Saami mythology, Bieka-Galles (or Biega-, Biegga-Galles, depending on dialect; \"The Old Man of the Winds\") is a deity who rules over rain and wind, and is the subject of boat and wooden shovel (or, rather, oar) offerings. Due to similarities in between descriptions of Njörðr in Gylfaginning and descriptions of Bieka-Galles in 18th century missionary reports, Axel Olrik identified this deity as the result of influence from the seafaring North Germanic peoples on the landbound Saami.[37]Parallels have been pointed out between Njörðr and the figure of Hadingus, attested in book I of Saxo Grammaticus' 13th century work Gesta Danorum.[38] Some of these similarities include that, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Skáldskaparmál, Hadingus is chosen by his wife Regnhild after selecting him from other men at a banquet by his lower legs, and, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Gylfaginning, Hadingus complains in verse of his displeasure at his life away from the sea and how he is disturbed by the howls of wolves, while his wife Regnhild complains of life at the shore and states her annoyance at the screeching sea birds.[38] Georges Dumézil theorized that in the tale Hadingus passes through all three functions of his trifunctional hypothesis, before ending as an Odinic hero, paralleling Njörðr's passing from the Vanir to the Æsir in the Æsir-Vanir War.[39]In stanza 8 of the poem Fjölsvinnsmál, Svafrþorinn is stated as the father of Menglöð by an unnamed mother, who the hero Svipdagr seeks. Menglöð has often been theorized as the goddess Freyja, and according to this theory, Svafrþorinn would therefore be Njörðr. The theory is complicated by the etymology of the name Svafrþorinn (þorinn meaning \"brave\" and svafr means \"gossip\") (or possibly connects to sofa \"sleep\"), which Rudolf Simek says makes little sense when attempting to connect it to Njörðr.[40]Njörðr has been the subject of an amount of artistic depictions. Depictions include \"Freyr und Gerda; Skade und Niurd\" (drawing, 1883) by K. Ehrenberg, \"Njörðr\" (1893) by Carl Frederick von Saltza, \"Skadi\" (1901) by E. Doepler d. J., and \"Njörd's desire of the Sea\" (1908) by W. G. Collingwood.Njörðr is one of the incarnated gods in the New Zealand comedy/drama \"The Almighty Johnsons\". The part of \"Johan Johnson/Njörðr\" is played by Stuart Devenie.[41]","path":[70260,5.315444,62.03832,70140,5.276523,62.03355,69840,5.217213,62.00879,69720,5.182248,61.99169,69600,5.156137,61.9808,69480,5.1516,61.96218,69360,5.1372,61.94501,69240,5.122205,61.93643,69120,5.114938,61.93295,68880,5.11424,61.93317,68700,5.118533,61.93212,68520,5.125388,61.91524,68340,5.1559,61.89356,68220,5.176843,61.87783,68100,5.215977,61.87396,67980,5.250295,61.86649,67860,5.287698,61.86251,67740,5.312308,61.86166,67560,5.306642,61.86171,67440,5.277695,61.84883,66960,5.146924,61.81187,66480,5.020785,61.78316,66360,4.979148,61.77322,66180,4.949125,61.7789,65940,4.949518,61.77888,65820,4.958508,61.76391,65700,4.960932,61.74525,65580,4.961838,61.72743,65460,4.961125,61.70976,65340,4.96149,61.69221,65220,4.962976,61.67476,65100,4.973808,61.6584,64980,4.983848,61.64193,64860,4.990092,61.62467,64740,5.00967,61.60941,64620,5.022592,61.60337,64500,5.029528,61.60184,64380,5.02951,61.60178,64200,5.024692,61.60264,64080,5.012693,61.60295,63960,4.980203,61.60026,63840,4.95572,61.5911,63720,4.957317,61.57643,63600,4.979227,61.56487,63420,5.000385,61.55205,63240,5.001333,61.52783,63120,4.996628,61.50733,63000,4.984941,61.49225,62880,4.983508,61.47735,62760,4.978673,61.46143,62640,4.967188,61.44594,62520,4.969568,61.42957,62400,4.969841,61.41324,62280,4.984398,61.39887,61080,5.025807,61.31133,60300,4.948375,61.22393,58500,5.023067,61.00549,58020,5.018532,60.9714,57900,4.975723,60.97091,57660,4.927615,60.95977,57540,4.912477,60.94483,57420,4.893188,60.92966,57300,4.900877,60.9185,57120,4.901217,60.91584,57000,4.909447,60.89931,56880,4.924928,60.88336,56760,4.938364,60.86709,56640,4.941877,60.84983,56520,4.941805,60.83222,56400,4.943648,60.81445,56280,4.951072,60.80259,56100,4.959547,60.79731,55980,4.988165,60.78672,55740,5.027427,60.76573,55560,5.026168,60.74503,55380,5.046728,60.72054,55200,5.078155,60.69983,55020,5.112802,60.67993,54840,5.113067,60.66451,54660,5.11739,60.65568,54540,5.143533,60.64192,54420,5.170836,60.6306,54300,5.193268,60.61671,54180,5.209281,60.60079,54060,5.224542,60.58693,53940,5.227857,60.57833,53820,5.229485,60.57229,53700,5.232503,60.56295,53580,5.258683,60.55096,53460,5.276193,60.53658,53340,5.270827,60.51924,53220,5.25843,60.50274,53040,5.253775,60.48162,52860,5.265487,60.45664,52680,5.279447,60.43147,52500,5.301698,60.40819,52320,5.315282,60.39933,52140,5.32235,60.39551,51480,5.322367,60.39523,50220,5.322357,60.39523,48960,5.322353,60.39523,47520,5.322381,60.39525,46260,5.322381,60.39524,45000,5.322348,60.39524,43740,5.322357,60.39524,42300,5.322345,60.39526,40860,5.322371,60.39521,39600,5.322345,60.39524,38340,5.32236,60.39525,37080,5.322367,60.39524,35760,5.322357,60.39525,35640,5.32221,60.39533,35520,5.317902,60.39763,35280,5.308905,60.40109,35160,5.296363,60.40731,35040,5.283072,60.42611,34920,5.269755,60.4436,34800,5.259505,60.4609,34680,5.252234,60.47864,34560,5.254722,60.49668,34440,5.265986,60.51376,34320,5.275903,60.53072,34200,5.267497,60.54727,34080,5.239123,60.55931,33960,5.23001,60.56836,33780,5.229462,60.5753,33600,5.223767,60.5855,33420,5.205892,60.60425,33240,5.176547,60.62647,33060,5.135297,60.64543,32940,5.115692,60.65637,32820,5.113437,60.66183,32700,5.11316,60.66693,32580,5.112687,60.67332,32460,5.102823,60.68873,32340,5.075489,60.70086,32220,5.050323,60.71367,32100,5.038277,60.73112,31980,5.025518,60.74728,31860,5.037776,60.75982,31680,5.010073,60.77515,31500,4.963878,60.7953,31380,4.950952,60.80258,31260,4.949503,60.80285,31140,4.94496,60.81895,31020,4.943838,60.83659,30900,4.942035,60.85425,30780,4.934435,60.87117,30660,4.920629,60.88754,30540,4.905695,60.90384,30420,4.901035,60.91815,30180,4.893919,60.9315,30000,4.936163,60.94475,29880,4.953454,60.94372,29760,4.951036,60.94353,29640,4.930797,60.95606,29520,4.92483,60.97349,29400,4.919243,60.99121,29220,4.922029,61.01409,28980,4.956604,61.04372,27120,4.920321,61.26496,26880,4.954518,61.28764,25800,5.025713,61.36733,25500,4.977642,61.40585,25380,4.972602,61.423,25260,4.977983,61.44075,25140,4.98075,61.45825,25020,4.98252,61.47583,24900,4.986814,61.49348,24780,5.000033,61.51021,24660,5.00121,61.52776,24420,4.994165,61.55463,24240,4.958364,61.57479,24060,4.964087,61.59827,23940,5.008123,61.60248,23820,5.021665,61.60336,23700,5.029675,61.60201,23520,5.029528,61.60177,23340,5.020417,61.60357,23220,5.009785,61.60977,22980,4.985547,61.63855,22800,4.970165,61.66335,22620,4.960932,61.68841,22440,4.963447,61.71448,22320,4.964927,61.73237,22200,4.963708,61.75164,22020,4.956079,61.77316,21600,4.985937,61.77479,21480,5.01942,61.7823,21360,5.047693,61.78853,21180,5.089795,61.79795,21060,5.135255,61.8076,20880,5.189162,61.81865,20700,5.226553,61.82569,20520,5.266805,61.84049,20340,5.302023,61.86142,20160,5.311968,61.86169,19980,5.262787,61.86378,19800,5.20831,61.8729,19620,5.17011,61.88662,19440,5.13759,61.9078,19320,5.118003,61.9218,19200,5.117227,61.93296,19080,5.114198,61.93316,18900,5.11494,61.93299,18720,5.125373,61.93769,18540,5.141634,61.94859,18360,5.152379,61.97309,18180,5.183619,61.99241,18060,5.21

After a short career as a pilot boat, owing to steam replacing sail, she became a fishing boat.Bought by E. G. Martin (Commander Evelyn George Martin RNR OBE) in 1923 she was refitted and won the first Fastnet race from seven starters in August 1925. In 1927 Martin sold Jolie Brise, through an advertisement in Yachting World to Captain Warren Ferrier and his partner Dr Brownlow Smith. An engine and an additional cabin were fitted at Morgan Giles's yard at Teignmouth. Bobby Somerset, a founder member of the Ocean Racing Club - as was Martin, purchased her in 1928. After competing in the Fastnet, Bermuda and Santander races he sold her four years later to Lt. John Gage RNR. His ownership was only for a year and it seems that in 1934 she was purchased by an American, Mr Stanley Mortimer. Alterations, mostly to the living accommodation were made at a yard in Palma, Majorca and a Gardner diesel was fitted in Marseilles. After cruising the Mediterranean Sea, and with war in the offing Jolie Brise returned to Southampton and was put up for sale. She was bought by William Stannard but requisitioned by the Royal Navy who laid her up on a mud berth at Shoreham for the duration of the war. In 1945 she was bought by a consortium headed by Lillian and Jim Worsdell and her name was changed to Pleasant Breeze. A voyage to New Zealand was aborted and when she put in to Lisbon she was acquired by a Portuguese consortium headed by Luis Lobato. Repaired and refitted, she was once again listed as Jolie Brise. For nearly 30 years her home port remained Lisbon but in 1975, partly because of the political situation in Portugal, she returned to the Solent, 50 years after her first Fastnet win.In 1977 she was bought for Dauntsey's School Sailing Club.Jolie Brise was one of a number of prestigious vessels to be moored along the route of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, to celebrate the diamond jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Due to her size, she was not part of the flotilla of vessels, and was instead moored with other vessels at St Katharine Docks, in a display known as the Avenue of Sail.

The dreamcatcher is then decorated with sacred items such as feathers and beads.Dreamcatchers originated with the Ojibwe people and were later adopted by some neighboring nations through intermarriage and trade. It wasn't until the Pan-Indian Movement of the 1960s and 1970s, that they were adopted by Native Americans of a number of different nations. Some consider the dreamcatcher a symbol of unity among the various Indian Nations, and a general symbol of identification with Native American or First Nations cultures. However, many other Native Americans have come to see dreamcatchers as over-commercialized, offensively misappropriated and misused by non-Natives.[3]The Ojibwe people have an ancient legend about the origin of the dreamcatcher. Storytellers speak of the Spider Woman, known as Asibikaashi; she took care of the children and the people on the land. Eventually, the Ojibwe Nation spread to the corners of North America and it became difficult for Asibikaashi to reach all the children. So the mothers and grandmothers would weave magical webs for the children, using willow hoops and sinew, or cordage made from plants. The dreamcatchers would filter out all bad dreams and only allow good thoughts to enter our mind. Once the sun rises, all bad dreams just disappear.[4] American ethnographer Frances Densmore writes in her book Chippewa Customs (1929, republished 1979, pg. 113):Even infants were provided with protective charms. Examples of these are the \"spiderwebs\" hung on the hoop of a cradle board. These articles consisted of wooden hoops about 3½ inches in diameter filled with an imitation of a spider's web made of fine yarn, usually dyed red. In old times this netting was made of nettle fiber. Two spider webs were usually hung on the hoop, and it was said that they \"caught any harm that might be in the air as a spider's web catches and holds whatever comes in contact with it.\"Traditionally, the Ojibwe construct dreamcatchers by tying sinew strands in a web around a small round or tear-shaped frame of willow (in a way roughly similar to their method for making snowshoe webbing). The resulting \"dream-catcher\", hung above the bed, is used as a charm to protect sleeping people, usually children, from nightmares.The Ojibwe believe that a dreamcatcher changes a person's dreams. According to Konrad J. Kaweczynski, \"Only good dreams would be allowed to filter through... Bad dreams would stay in the net, disappearing with the light of day.\"[5] Good dreams would pass through and slide down the feathers to the sleeper.When dreamcatchers were originally made, the Ojibwe people used willow hoops and sinew or cordage made from plants. The shape of the dreamcatcher is a circle because it represents how giizis – the sun, moon, month – travel each day across the sky.[6] There is meaning to every part of the dreamcatcher from the hoop to the beads embedded in the webbing.[7]In the course of becoming popular outside of the Ojibwa Nation, and then outside of the pan-Indian communities, various types of \"dreamcatchers,\" many of which bear little resemblance to the traditional styles, are now made, exhibited, and sold by New age groups and individuals. According to Philip Jenkins, this is considered by many traditional Native peoples and their supporters to be an undesirable form of cultural appropriation.[8]","path":[86100,5.501596,59.77909,84840,5.501632,59.77912,83580,5.501667,59.77915,82320,5.501653,59.77913,80700,5.501677,59.77909,79440,5.50163,59.77909,78180,5.501653,59.77909,76380,5.501578,59.7791,75120,5.501613,59.77908,73860,5.501598,59.77909,72600,5.501647,59.77909,71340,5.501613,59.7791,70080,5.50164,59.77908,68820,5.50164,59.77907,67380,5.501647,59.7791,66120,5.501663,59.77911,64860,5.501692,59.7791,63600,5.501615,59.77914,62340,5.501615,59.77913,61080,5.501655,59.7791,59820,5.501673,59.77907,58560,5.501606,59.77908,57300,5.501637,59.77911,57060,5.504287,59.78033,56940,5.509757,59.78131,56820,5.515535,59.77996,56700,5.521568,59.77817,56580,5.5279,59.77632,56400,5.538582,59.77485,56280,5.545068,59.77748,56160,5.54818,59.78127,56040,5.548028,59.78565,55920,5.54785,59.79001,55680,5.547328,59.79752,55500,5.546438,59.80389,55380,5.545622,59.80915,55260,5.545087,59.81339,55140,5.544542,59.8176,54720,5.542706,59.83224,54540,5.541873,59.83843,54300,5.540822,59.84673,54120,5.539872,59.85297,53940,5.539162,59.85803,42900,5.22087,60.17699,42480,5.201968,60.18746,42300,5.195024,60.19098,42060,5.186875,60.19672,41880,5.181972,60.20339,41580,5.17631,60.21125,41220,5.16816,60.22043,41040,5.16367,60.22481,40860,5.159945,60.23004,40560,5.15674,60.24078,40320,5.15394,60.24831,39960,5.1524,60.25999,39720,5.15061,60.26788,39300,5.14601,60.28081,39060,5.1444,60.28796,38700,5.14135,60.29814,38460,5.14234,60.30486,38100,5.14593,60.31504,37860,5.14916,60.32195,37440,5.15878,60.33178,37200,5.16676,60.33721,36720,5.17182,60.35083,34380,5.237728,60.40148,34200,5.250092,60.40251,34080,5.258,60.40309,33840,5.271687,60.40312,33600,5.287358,60.4028,33480,5.297142,60.40265,33240,5.30926,60.40111,33120,5.31441,60.39946,32940,5.319318,60.39758,32820,5.322108,60.39695,31740,5.322552,60.39704,30300,5.322558,60.39701,29040,5.322538,60.39697,27780,5.322516,60.39697,26520,5.322546,60.39696,25260,5.322556,60.39697,24000,5.322533,60.39699,22740,5.322543,60.39697,21480,5.32254,60.39698,20220,5.322546,60.39697,18960,5.322518,60.39697,17700,5.322515,60.39697,16440,5.322507,60.39696,15180,5.322497,60.39698,13740,5.322482,60.39697,12480,5.322467,60.39698,11220,5.322495,60.39698,9960,5.322492,60.397,8700,5.322516,60.39702,7440,5.322497,60.39699,6180,5.322462,60.397,4920,5.322488,60.397,3660,5.322523,60.39698,2400,5.322553,60.39699,1140,5.322613,60.39702]},{"name":"FRYDERYK CHOPIN","text":"FRYDERYK CHOPIN:Frédéric François Chopin (/ˈʃoʊpæn/; French pronunciation: ​[fʁe.de.ʁik ʃo.pɛ̃]; 22 February or 1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849), born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin,[n 1] was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era, who wrote primarily for the solo piano. He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of his era, whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.\"[1] Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, and grew up in Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed many of his works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising.At the age of 21 he settled in Paris. Thereafter, during the last 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to a Polish girl, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health. He died in Paris in 1849, probably of tuberculosis.All of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include sonatas, mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, and preludes, some published only after his death. Many contain elements of both Polish folk music and of the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, the music of all of whom he admired. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.Both in his native Poland and beyond, Chopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his association (if only indirect) with political insurrection, his love life and his early death have made him, in the public consciousness, a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy.Fryderyk Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola,[2] 46 kilometres (29 miles) west of Warsaw, in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, a Polish state established by Napoleon. The parish baptismal record gives his birthday as 22 February 1810, and cites his given names in the Latin form Fridericus Franciscus[2] (in Polish, he was Fryderyk Franciszek).[3] However, the composer and his family used the birthdate 1 March,[n 2][2] which is now generally accepted as the correct date.[5]Fryderyk's father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman from Lorraine who had emigrated to Poland in 1787 at the age of sixteen.[6] Nicolas tutored children of the Polish aristocracy, and in 1806 married Justyna Krzyżanowska, a poor relation of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked.[7] Fryderyk was baptized on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1810, in the same church where his parents had married, in Brochów.[2] His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin.[2] Fryderyk was the couple's second child and only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika (1807–55), and two younger sisters, Izabela (1811–81) and Emilia (1812–27).[8] Nicolas was devoted to his adopted homeland, and insisted on the use of the Polish language in the household.[2]In October 1810, six months after Fryderyk's birth, the family moved to Warsaw, where his father acquired a post teaching French at the Warsaw Lyceum, then housed in the Saxon Palace. Fryderyk lived with his family in the Palace grounds. The father played the flute and violin;[9] the mother played the piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the Chopins kept.[10] Chopin was of slight build, and even in early childhood was prone to illnesses.[11]Fryderyk may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the Czech pianist Wojciech Żywny.[12] His elder sister Ludwika also took lessons from Żywny, and occasionally played duets with her brother.[13] It quickly became apparent that he was a child prodigy. By the age of seven Fryderyk had begun giving public concerts, and in 1817 he composed two polonaises, in G minor and B-flat major.[14] His next work, a polonaise in A-flat major of 1821, dedicated to Żywny, is his earliest surviving musical manuscript.[12]In 1817 the Saxon Palace was requisitioned by Warsaw's Russian governor for military use, and the Warsaw Lyceum was reestablished in the Kazimierz Palace (today the rectorate of Warsaw University). Fryderyk and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. During this period, Fryderyk was sometimes invited to the Belweder Palace as playmate to the son of the ruler of Russian Poland, Grand Duke Constantine; he played the piano for the Duke and composed a march for him. Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, in his dramatic eclogue, \"Nasze Przebiegi\" (\"Our Discourses\", 1818), attested to \"little Chopin's\" popularity.[15]From September 1823 to 1826 Chopin attended the Warsaw Lyceum, where he took organ lessons from the Czech musician Wilhelm Würfel during his first year. In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the Silesian composer Józef Elsner at the Warsaw Conservatory, studying music theory, figured bass and composition.[16][n 3] Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of a mechanical organ, the \"eolomelodicon\", and on this instrument in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by Moscheles. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a similar recital on the instrument before Tsar Alexander I, who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent eolomelodicon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his Rondo Op. 1. This was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press, when the Leipzig Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung praised his \"wealth of musical ideas\".[17]During 1824–28 Chopin spent his vacations away from Warsaw, at a number of locales.[n 4] In 1824 and 1825, at Szafarnia, he was a guest of Dominik Dziewanowski, the father of a schoolmate. Here for the first time he encountered Polish rural folk music.[19] His letters home from Szafarnia (to which he gave the title \"The Szafarnia Courier\"), written in a very modern and lively Polish, amused his family with their spoofing of the Warsaw newspapers and demonstrated the youngster's literary gift.[20]In 1827, soon after the death of Chopin's youngest sister Emilia, the family moved from the Warsaw University building, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace, to lodgings just across the street from the university, in the south annex of the Krasiński Palace on Krakowskie Przedmieście,[n 5] where Chopin lived until he left Warsaw in 1830.[n 6] Here his parents continued running their boarding house for male students; the Chopin Family Parlour (Salonik Chopinów) became a museum in the 20th century. In 1829 the artist Ambroży Mieroszewski executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members, including the first known portrait of the composer.[n 7]Four boarders at his parents' apartments became Chopin's intimates: Tytus Woyciechowski, Jan Nepomucen Białobłocki, Jan Matuszyński and Julian Fontana; the latter two would become part of his Paris milieu. He was friendly with members of Warsaw's young artistic and intellectual world, including Fontana, Józef Bohdan Zaleski and Stefan Witwicki.[23] He was also attracted to the singing student Konstancja Gładkowska. In letters to Woyciechowski, he indicated which of his works, and even which of their passages, were influenced by his fascination with her; his letter of 15 May 1830 revealed that the slow movement (Larghetto) of his Piano Concerto No. 1 (in E minor) was secretly dedicated to her – \"It should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime – by moonlight.\"[24] His final Conservatory report (July 1829) read \"Chopin F., third year student, exceptional talent, musical genius.\"[16]In September 1828 Chopin, while still a student, visited Berlin with a family friend, zoologist Feliks Jarocki, enjoying operas directed by Gaspare Spontini and attending concerts by Carl Friedrich Zelter, Felix Mendelssohn and other celebrities. On an 1829 return trip to Berlin, he was a guest of Prince Antoni Radziwiłł, governor of the Grand Duchy of Posen—himself an accomplished composer and aspiring cellist. For the prince and his pianist daughter Wanda, he composed his Introduction and Polonaise brillante in C major for cello and piano, Op. 3.[25]Back in Warsaw that year, Chopin heard Niccolò Paganini play the violin, and composed a set of variations, Souvenir de Paganini. It may have been this experience which encouraged him to commence writing his first Études, (1829–32), exploring the capacities of his own instrument.[26] On 11 August, three weeks after completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory, he made his debut in Vienna. He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews—in addition to some commenting (in Chopin's own words) that he was \"too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists\". In one of these concerts, he premiered his Variations on Là ci darem la mano, Op. 2 (variations on an aria from Mozart's opera Don Giovanni) for piano and orchestra.[27] He returned to Warsaw in September 1829,[28] where he premiered his Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor, Op. 21 on 17 March 1830.[16]Chopin's successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzisław Jachimecki, \"into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever.\"[29] With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, \"I curse the moment of my departure.\"[30] When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: \"O God! ... You are there, and yet you do not take vengeance!\"[31] Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer's maturing \"into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland.\"[29]Chopin arrived in Paris in late September 1831; he would never return to Poland,[32] thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport.[33] However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.[34]In Paris, Chopin encountered artists and other distinguished figures, and found many opportunities to exercise his talents and achieve celebrity. During his years in Paris he was to become acquainted with, among many others, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Ferdinand Hiller, Heinrich Heine, Eugène Delacroix, and Alfred de Vigny.[35] Chopin was also acquainted with the poet Adam Mickiewicz, principal of the Polish Literary Society, some of whose verses he set as songs.[36]Two Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin's life there. His fellow student at the Warsaw Conservatory, Julian Fontana, had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in England; Albert Grzymała, who in Paris became a wealthy financier and society figure, often acted as Chopin's adviser and \"gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [his] life.\"[37] Fontana was to become, in the words of Michałowski and Samson, Chopin's \"general factotum and copyist\".[38]At the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when Robert Schumann, reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (his first published article on music), declared: \"Hats off, gentlemen! A genius.\"[39] On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: \"Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...\"[40] After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite).[41] By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe.[42] This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.[41]Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons, but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends. The musicologist Arthur Hedley has observed that \"As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances—few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime.\"[43] The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony.[44] Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with Maurice Schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.[45]In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn.[46] In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig.[47] The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses.[48] In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \"a perfect musician\".[49] In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodziński family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade.[50] At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1.[51] The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.[52]Although it is not known exactly when Chopin first met Liszt after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that \"I have met Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot, etc.—also Kalkbrenner. You would not believe how curious I was about Herz, Liszt, Hiller, etc.\"[53] Liszt was in attendance at Chopin's Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle Pleyel, which led him to remark: \"The most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art.\"[54]The two became friends, and for many years lived in close proximity in Paris, Chopin at 38 Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, and Liszt at the Hôtel de France on the Rue Lafitte, a few blocks away.[55] They performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841. The first, on 2 April 1833, was at a benefit concert organized by Hector Berlioz for his bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife Harriet Smithson, during which they played George Onslow's Sonata in F minor for piano duet.[54] Later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the Benevolent Association of Polish Ladies in Paris.[54] Their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the Beethoven Memorial in Bonn, held at the Salle Pleyel and the Paris Conservatory on 25 and 26 April 1841.[54]Although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a \"tinge of jealousy and spite\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano,[55] and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success.[56] Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\"[57] However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\".[55] Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand.[54]In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).[55] Short (under five feet, or 152 cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker,[58] she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, \"What an unattractive person la Sand is. Is she really a woman?\"[59] However, by early 1837 Maria Wodzińska's mother had made it clear to Chopin in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed.[60] It is thought that she was influenced by his poor health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as d'Agoult and Sand.[61] Chopin finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, \"My tragedy\".[62] Sand, in a letter to Grzymała of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with Chopin; she asked Grzymała to assess Chopin's relationship with Maria Wodzińska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was over.[63]In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer Camille Pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood.[64] On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, and by the end of June 1838 they had become lovers.[65] Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: \"I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ...\"[66] The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover Félicien Mallefille.[67] After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable,[68] making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.[65]On 3 December, Chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of the doctors in Majorca: \"Three doctors have visited me ... The first said I was dead; the second said I was dying; and the third said I was about to die.\"[69] He also had problems having his Pleyel piano sent to him. It finally arrived from Paris in December. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: \"I am sending you my Preludes [(Op. 28)]. I finished them on your little piano, which arrived in the best possible condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs.\"[65] Chopin was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.[70]Although this period had been productive, the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts.[71][n 8] The group traveled first to Barcelona, then to Marseilles, where they stayed for a few months while Chopin convalesced.[73] In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at Nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence.[74] In 1842 he and Sand moved to the Square d'Orléans, living in adjacent buildings.[75]At the funeral of the tenor Adolphe Nourrit in Paris in 1839, Chopin made a rare appearance at the organ, playing a transcription of Franz Schubert's lied Die Gestirne.[76] On 26 July 1840 Chopin and Sand were present at the dress rehearsal of Berlioz's Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale, composed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution. Chopin was reportedly unimpressed with the composition.[77]During the summers at Nohant, particularly in the years 1839–43, Chopin found quiet, productive days during which he composed many works, including his Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53. Among the visitors to Nohant were Delacroix and the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, whom Chopin had advised on piano technique and composition.[78] Delacroix gives an account of staying at Nohant in a letter of 7 June 1842:The hosts could not be more pleasant in entertaining me. When we are not all together at dinner, lunch, playing billiards, or walking, each of us stays in his room, reading or lounging around on a couch. Sometimes, through the window which opens on the garden, a gust of music wafts up from Chopin at work. All this mingles with the songs of nightingales and the fragrance of roses.[79]From 1842 onwards, Chopin showed signs of serious illness. After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: \"I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.\"[80] He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard's on 1 March 1843.[81] Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him \"hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain\", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor.[82] Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.[83]Chopin's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange's fiancé, the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Clésinger.[84] The composer frequently took Solange's side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand's son Maurice.[85] Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand's radical political pursuits, while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain.[86] As the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her \"third child\". In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a \"child,\" a \"little angel\", a \"sufferer\" and a \"beloved little corpse.\"[87] In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani, whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer's galleys. In 1847 he did not visit Nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made \"a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship.\"[84] The two would never meet again.[88]Chopin's output as a composer throughout this period declined in quantity year by year. Whereas in 1841 he had written a dozen works, only six were written in 1842 and six shorter pieces in 1843. In 1844 he wrote only the Op. 58 sonata. 1845 saw the completion of three mazurkas (Op. 59). Although these works were more refined than many of his earlier compositions, Zamoyski opines that \"his powers of concentration were failing and his inspiration was beset by anguish, both emotional and intellectual.\"[89]Chopin's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane, as did the number of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially.[88] In February 1848, with the cellist Auguste Franchomme, he gave his last Paris concert, which included three movements of the Cello Sonata Op. 65.In April, during the Revolution of 1848 in Paris, he left for London, where he performed at several concerts and at numerous receptions in great houses.[87] This tour was suggested to him by his Scottish pupil Jane Stirling and her elder sister. Stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.[90]In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea (£1.05 in present British currency) per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts.[91]In late summer he was invited by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire, both owned by members of Stirling's family.[92] She clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged to make it clear to her that this could not be so. He wrote at this time to Grzymała \"My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores\", and responding to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was \"closer to the grave than the nuptial bed.\"[93] He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September,[94] and another in Edinburgh, at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October.[95] In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam Łyszczyński, he wrote out his last will and testament—\"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere\", he wrote to Grzymała.[87]Chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform at London's Guildhall on 16 November 1848, when, in a final patriotic gesture, he played for the benefit of Polish refugees. He was at this time clearly seriously ill, weighing less than 99 pounds (45 kg), and his doctors were aware that his sickness was at a terminal stage.[96]At the end of November, Chopin returned to Paris. He passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and Franchomme. Occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of Delfina Potocka, for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in Chaillot, out of the centre of the city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff. Here in June 1849 he was visited by Jenny Lind.[97]With his health further deteriorating, Chopin desired to have a family member with him. In June 1849 his sister Ludwika came to Paris with her husband and daughter, and in September, supported by a loan from Jane Stirling, he took an apartment at Place Vendôme 12.[98] After 15 October, when his condition took a marked turn for the worse, only a handful of his closest friends remained with him, although Viardot remarked sardonically that \"all the grand Parisian ladies considered it de rigueur to faint in his room.\"[96]Some of his friends provided music at his request; among them, Potocka sang and Franchomme played the cello. Chopin requested that his body be opened after death (for fear of being buried alive) and his heart returned to Warsaw.[99] He also bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method, Projet de méthode, to Alkan for completion.[100] On 17 October, after midnight, the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly. \"No longer\", he replied. He died a few minutes before two o'clock in the morning. Those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister Ludwika, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska, Sand's daughter Solange, and his close friend Thomas Albrecht. Later that morning, Solange's husband Clésinger made Chopin's death mask and a cast of his left hand.[101]Chopin's disease and the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His death certificate gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease.[102] Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis,[103] cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.[104] However, the attribution of tuberculosis as principal cause of death has not been disproved.[105] Permission for DNA testing, which could put the matter to rest, has been denied by the Polish government.[106]The funeral, held at the Church of the Madeleine in Paris, was delayed almost two weeks, until 30 October.[107] Entrance was restricted to ticket holders[108] as many people were expected to attend.[107] Over 3,000 people arrived without invitations, from as far as London, Berlin and Vienna, and were excluded.[109]Mozart's Requiem was sung at the funeral;[108] the soloists were the soprano Jeanne-Anais Castellan, the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, the tenor Alexis Dupont, and the bass Luigi Lablache; Chopin's Preludes No. 4 in E minor and No. 6 in B minor were also played. The organist at the funeral was Louis Lefébure-Wély.[110] The funeral procession to Père Lachaise Cemetery, which included Chopin's sister Ludwika, was led by the aged Prince Adam Czartoryski. The pallbearers included Delacroix, Franchomme, and Camille Pleyel.[111] At the graveside, the Funeral March from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played, in Reber's instrumentation.[112]Chopin's tombstone, featuring the muse of music, Euterpe, weeping over a broken lyre, was designed and sculpted by Clésinger. The expenses of the funeral and monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid for the return of the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw.[111] Ludwika took Chopin's heart in an urn, preserved in alcohol, back to Poland in 1850.[113][n 9] She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who seems to have destroyed them.[113]Over 230 works of Chopin survive; some compositions from early childhood have been lost. All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either piano concertos, songs or chamber music.[116]Chopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart and Clementi; he used Clementi's piano method with his own students. He was also influenced by Hummel's development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited Bach and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook.[117] Chopin's early works are in the style of the \"brilliant\" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of Ignaz Moscheles, Friedrich Kalkbrenner, and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of Italian opera. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his fioriture) is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the modes and features of the music of his native country, such as drones.[118]Chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish composer John Field, to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write ballades[119] and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op. 28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op. 10 published in 1833, Op. 25 in 1837).[120]Chopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. Chopin's mazurkas, while originating in the traditional Polish dance (the mazurek), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; \"it was Chopin who put the mazurka on the European musical map.\"[121] The series of seven polonaises published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the Op. 26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form.[122] His waltzes were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.[123]Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others.[124] There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time.[125] The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.[126]The last opus number that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66–73), published in 1855.[127] In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.[128]Works published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers. The present standard musicological reference for Chopin's works is the Kobylańska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'KK'), named for its compiler, the Polish musicologist Krystyna Kobylańska.[129]Chopin's original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel.[130] His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies.[131] The first collected edition was by Breitkopf & Härtel (1878–1902).[132] Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin's works are the version under the name of Paderewski published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent Polish \"National Edition\", edited by Jan Ekier, both of which contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.[133][134]Improvisation stands at the centre of Chopin's creative processes. However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that \"improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form.\"[135] The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be \"merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing ... formally longwinded and extremely conservative\".[136] After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello; \"instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure.\"[137] Rosen suggests that an important aspect of Chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar phrase as a structural unit.[138]J. Barrie Jones suggests that \"amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme\", and adds that \"the Barcarolle Op. 60 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody.\"[139] Temperley opines that these works, which contain \"immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail\", are based on an extended \"departure and return\" form; \"the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes.\"[140]Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward ternary or episodic form, sometimes with a coda.[141] The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example Op. 63 No. 3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.[142]Chopin's polonaises show a marked advance on those of his Polish predecessors in the form (who included his teachers Zywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.[143]The 21 nocturnes are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of Field (whom Chopin met in 1833). Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on the performer) which heightens their dramatic character.[144]Chopin's études are largely in straightforward ternary form.[145] He used them to teach his own technique of piano playing[41]—for instance playing double thirds (Op. 25, No. 6), playing in octaves (Op. 25, No. 10), and playing repeated notes (Op. 10, No.  7).[146]The preludes, many of which are very brief (some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure), were described by Schumann as \"the beginnings of studies\".[147] Inspired by J.S. Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, Chopin's preludes move up the circle of fifths (rather than Bach's chromatic scale sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality.[148] The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers, as Kenneth Hamilton suggests: he has noted a recording by Ferruccio Busoni of 1922, in which the Prelude Op. 28 No. 7 is followed by the Étude Op. 10 No. 5.[149]The two mature piano sonatas (No. 2, Op. 35, written in 1839 and No. 3, Op. 58, written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op. 35, Chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique—\"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle\".[150] The last movement, a brief (75-bar) perpetuum mobile in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison throughout, was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries, including Schumann.[151] The Op. 58 sonata is closer to the German tradition, including many passages of complex counterpoint, \"worthy of Brahms\" according to the music historians Kornel Michałowski and Jim Samson.[150]Chopin's harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique. Temperley says that in his works \"novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment\", and cadences are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key (neapolitan sixths and diminished sevenths), or by sudden shifts to remote keys. Chord progressions sometimes anticipate the shifting tonality of later composers such as Claude Debussy, as does Chopin's use of modal harmony.[152]In 1841, Léon Escudier wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\"[153] Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: \"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\"[154] He further stated: \"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\"[155] The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.[156]Jonathan Bellman writes that modern concert performance style—set in the \"conservatory\" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique.[157] The composer himself said to a pupil that \"concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art.\"[158] Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as \"always crescendo to a high note\", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring.[159] Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin \"has created a kind of chromatic embroidery ... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe ... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn\".[160] Hiller wrote that \"What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers.\"[161]Chopin's music is frequently played with rubato, \"the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect\".[162] There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of rubato is appropriate for his works. Charles Rosen comments that \"most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas ... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart ... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass ... An allied form of this rubato is the arpeggiation of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil, Karol Mikuli, Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice.\"[163]Friederike Müller, a pupil of Chopin, wrote: \"[His] playing was always noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full forte or softest piano. He took infinite pains to teach his pupils this legato, cantabile style of playing. His most severe criticism was \"He—or she—does not know how to join two notes together.\" He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced rubatos, as well as exaggerated ritardandos ... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works.\"[164]The \"Polish character\" of Chopin's work is unquestionable; not because he also wrote polonaises and mazurkas ... which forms ... were often stuffed with alien ideological and literary contents from the outside. ... As an artist he looked for forms that stood apart from the literary-dramatic character of music which was a feature of Romanticism, as a Pole he reflected in his work the very essence of the tragic break in the history of the people and instinctively aspired to give the deepest expression of his nation ... For he understood that he could invest his music with the most enduring and truly Polish qualities only by liberating art from the confines of dramatic and historical contents. This attitude toward the question of \"national music\" – an inspired solution to his art – was the reason why Chopin's works have come to be understood everywhere outside of Poland ... Therein lies the strange riddle of his eternal vigour.With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of nationalism. Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing that \"Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the November 1830 rising], their appeal to us artists is even stronger ... [I]f the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. Alexander I of Russia] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!\"[166] The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein)[167] claims that Chopin \"must be ranked first among the first musicians ... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation.\"[168]Some modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy as a \"nationalist\" or \"patriotic\" composer. George Golos refers to earlier \"nationalist\" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's Michał Kleofas Ogiński and Franciszek Lessel, who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms.[169] Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from \"urbanised\" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts (by Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis.[170] Richard Taruskin impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's works as patronizing [171] and comments that Chopin \"felt his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely\" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Field.[172]A reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood: \"Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World ... While some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people ...\"[173]Jones comments that \"Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned.\"[145] He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831—\"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons\"—and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation.[123] While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism, the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soirées) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that \"his lack of Byronic flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional\" among his romantic contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz.[137]Chopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognized by many of his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite Carnaval, and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works.[57] Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.[174]Two of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli (1821–1897) and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their own students, some of whom (such as Raoul Koczalski) were to make recordings of his music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin's style include Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Édouard Wolff (1816–1880) and Pierre Zimmermann.[175] Debussy dedicated his own 1915 piano Études to the memory of Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the Paris Conservatoire, and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the publisher Jacques Durand.[176]Polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as Moritz Moszkowski, but, in the opinion of J. Barrie Jones, his \"one worthy successor\" among his compatriots was Karol Szymanowski (1882–1937).[177] Edvard Grieg, Antonín Dvořák, Isaac Albéniz, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninoff, among others, are regarded by critics as having been influenced by Chopin's use of national modes and idioms.[178] Alexander Scriabin was devoted to the music of Chopin, and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas, as well as numerous études and preludes; his teacher Nikolai Zverev drilled him in Chopin's works to improve his virtuosity as a performer.[179] In the 20th century, composers who paid homage to (or in some cases parodied) the music of Chopin included George Crumb, Bohuslav Martinů, Darius Milhaud, Igor Stravinsky[180] and Heitor Villa-Lobos.[181]Chopin's music was used in the 1909 ballet Chopiniana, choreographed by Michel Fokine and orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov. Sergei Diaghilev commissioned additional orchestrations—from Stravinsky, Anatoly Lyadov, Sergei Taneyev and Nikolai Tcherepnin—for later productions, which used the title Les Sylphides.[182]Chopin's music remains very popular and is regularly performed, recorded and broadcast worldwide. The world's oldest monographic music competition, the International Chopin Piano Competition, founded in 1927, is held every five years in Warsaw.[183] The Fryderyk Chopin Institute of Poland lists on its website over eighty societies world-wide devoted to the composer and his music.[184] The Institute site also lists nearly 1,500 performances of Chopin works on YouTube as of January 2014.[185]The British Library notes that \"Chopin's works have been recorded by all the great pianists of the recording era.\" The earliest recording was an 1895 performance by Paul Pabst of the Nocturne in E major Op. 62 No. 2. The British Library site makes available a number of historic recordings, including some by Alfred Cortot, Ignaz Friedman, Vladimir Horowitz, Benno Moiseiwitsch, Paderewski, Arthur Rubinstein, Xaver Scharwenka and many others.[186] A select discography of recordings of Chopin works by pianists representing the various pedagogic traditions stemming from Chopin is given by Methuen-Campbell in his work tracing the lineage and character of those traditions.[187]Numerous recordings of Chopin's works are available. On the occasion of the composer's bicentenary, the critics of The New York Times recommended performances by the following contemporary pianists (among many others):[188] Martha Argerich, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Emanuel Ax, Evgeny Kissin, Murray Perahia, Maurizio Pollini and Krystian Zimerman. The Warsaw Chopin Society organizes the Grand prix du disque de F. Chopin for notable Chopin recordings, held every five years.[189]Chopin has figured extensively in Polish literature, both in serious critical studies of his life and music and in fictional treatments. The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide; and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak.[190] There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English (see bibliography for some of these).Possibly the first venture into fictional treatments of Chopin's life was a fanciful operatic version of some of its events. Chopin was written by Giacomo Orefice and produced in Milan in 1901. All the music is derived from that of Chopin.[191]Chopin's life and his relations with George Sand have been fictionalized in numerous films. The 1945 biographical film A Song to Remember earned Cornel Wilde an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his portrayal of the composer. Other film treatments have included: La valse de l'adieu (France, 1928) by Henry Roussel, with Pierre Blanchar as Chopin; Impromptu (1991), starring Hugh Grant as Chopin; La note bleue (1991); and

The connectors mechanically couple and align the cores of fibers so light can pass. Better connectors lose very little light due to reflection or misalignment of the fibers. In all, about 100 fiber optic connectors have been introduced to the market.[1]Optical fiber connectors are used to join optical fibers where a connect/disconnect capability is required. Due to the polishing and tuning procedures that may be incorporated into optical connector manufacturing, connectors are generally assembled onto optical fiber in a supplier’s manufacturing facility. However, the assembly and polishing operations involved can be performed in the field, for example, to make cross-connect jumpers to size.Optical fiber connectors are used in telephone company central offices, at installations on customer premises, and in outside plant applications to connect equipment and cables, or to cross-connect cables.Most optical fiber connectors are spring-loaded, so the fiber faces are pressed together when the connectors are mated. The resulting glass-to-glass or plastic-to-plastic contact eliminates signal losses that would be caused by an air gap between the joined fibers.Every fiber connection has two values:Measurements of these parameters are now defined in IEC standard 61753-1. The standard gives five grades for insertion loss from A (best) to D (worst), and M for multimode. The other parameter is return loss, with grades from 1 (best) to 5 (worst).A variety of optical fiber connectors are available, but SC and LC connectors are the most common types of connectors on the market.[citation needed] Typical connectors are rated for 500–1,000 mating cycles.[2] The main differences among types of connectors are dimensions and methods of mechanical coupling. Generally, organizations will standardize on one kind of connector, depending on what equipment they commonly use. Different connectors are required for multimode, and for single-mode fibers.In many data center applications, small (e.g., LC) and multi-fiber (e.g., MTP) connectors are replacing larger, older styles (e.g., SC), allowing more fiber ports per unit of rack space.Features of good connector design:Outside plant applications may require connectors be located underground, or on outdoor walls or utility poles. In such settings, protective enclosures are often used, and fall into two broad categories: hermetic (sealed) and free-breathing. Hermetic cases prevent entry of moisture and air but, lacking ventilation, can become hot if exposed to sunlight or other sources of heat. Free-breathing enclosures, on the other hand, allow ventilation, but can also admit moisture, insects and airborne contaminants. Selection of the correct housing depends on the cable and connector type, the location, and environmental factors. Careful assembly is required to ensure good protection against the elements.Depending on user requirements, housings for outside plant applications may be tested by the manufacturer under various environmental simulations, which could include physical shock and vibration, water spray, water immersion, dust, etc. to ensure the integrity of optical fiber connections and housing seals.Many types of optical connector have been developed at different times, and for different purposes. Many of them are summarized in the tables below.Field-mountable optical fiber connectors are used to join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one singlemode fiber. These assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed connector assemblies and multiple-jointed connector assemblies. According to Telcordia GR-1081,[12] a single-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where there is only one spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when connector assemblies are made from factory-assembled optical fiber connector plugs. A multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where there is more than one closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly that uses the stub-fiber type of connector plug.Field-mountable optical fiber connectors are used for field restoration work and to eliminate the need to stock jumper cords of various sizes.Glass fiber optic connector performance is affected both by the connector and by the glass fiber. Concentricity tolerances affect the fiber, fiber core, and connector body. The core optical index of refraction is also subject to variations. Stress in the polished fiber can cause excess return loss. The fiber can slide along its length in the connector. The shape of the connector tip may be incorrectly profiled during polishing. The connector manufacturer has little control over these factors, so in-service performance may well be below the manufacturer's specification.Testing fiber optic connector assemblies falls into two general categories: factory testing and field testing.Factory testing is sometimes statistical, for example, a process check. A profiling system may be used to ensure the overall polished shape is correct, and a good quality optical microscope to check for blemishes. Optical Loss / Return Loss performance is checked using specific reference conditions, against a reference-standard single mode test lead, or using an \"Encircled Flux Compliant\" source for multi-mode testing. Testing and rejection (\"yield\") may represent a significant part of the overall manufacturing cost.Field testing is usually simpler. A special hand-held optical microscope is used to check for dirt or blemishes. A power meter and light source or an optical loss test set (OLTS) is used to test end-to-end loss, and an optical time-domain reflectometer may be used to identify significant point losses or return losses.","path":[86220,5.770349,59.87748,84900,5.770349,59.87748,83640,5.770365,59.87747,82380,5.770332,59.87748,81120,5.770332,59.87748,79860,5.770332,59.87747,78600,5.770365,59.87748,77340,5.770365,59.87747,76020,5.770332,59.87747,74760,5.770381,59.87747,73500,5.770367,59.87747,72240,5.770367,59.87745,70800,5.770367,59.87745,69540,5.770333,59.87748,68220,5.77035,59.87747,66960,5.770333,59.87747,64980,5.770367,59.87747,63720,5.770367,59.87747,62460,5.770383,59.87747,61200,5.77035,59.87747,59880,5.770333,59.87748,58620,5.770333,59.87747,57360,5.77035,59.87747,56100,5.770367,59.87747,54840,5.770367,59.87747,53580,5.77035,59.87747,52320,5.770365,59.87745,51000,5.770349,59.87747,49740,5.770349,59.87747,48480,5.770332,59.87747,47220,5.770368,59.87747,45900,5.770212,59.87755,45780,5.769903,59.87774,45660,5.76961,59.87769,45540,5.768883,59.87797,45420,5.76812,59.87843,45180,5.768583,59.8794,45000,5.765378,59.87917,44820,5.756153,59.88287,44640,5.740433,59.88353,44460,5.7197,59.87781,44340,5.706089,59.87225,44220,5.692475,59.86655,44100,5.68013,59.86091,43980,5.6681,59.85503,43860,5.655113,59.84799,43680,5.642032,59.83955,43500,5.626522,59.82949,43380,5.614865,59.82232,43260,5.604232,59.81606,43140,5.593328,59.80974,43020,5.578758,59.80916,42900,5.56777,59.81439,42780,5.561665,59.82195,42600,5.555985,59.83097,42480,5.550802,59.83925,42360,5.54691,59.84677,42180,5.543075,59.85651,42000,5.53856,59.86848,41880,5.534712,59.87849,41700,5.53115,59.88678,41520,5.520695,59.89865,41400,5.512798,59.90714,41160,5.49571,59.92013,41040,5.484385,59.92701,39180,5.32695,60.01949,39000,5.32146,60.02826,38100,5.313502,60.08338,37920,5.306687,60.09529,37800,5.301723,60.10373,37680,5.296085,60.11273,37500,5.289653,60.12051,37320,5.279587,60.13276,37140,5.270782,60.14294,37020,5.260865,60.15043,36840,5.247705,60.16036,36660,5.23506,60.17042,36540,5.225345,60.17761,36360,5.21483,60.18559,36180,5.202295,60.19554,36060,5.192115,60.20382,35940,5.18275,60.21149,35700,5.169183,60.22249,35580,5.161073,60.23109,35460,5.156291,60.239,35220,5.151383,60.25085,35040,5.150368,60.26236,34920,5.15994,60.26932,34800,5.17159,60.27522,34680,5.18123,60.28023,34500,5.189435,60.28864,34320,5.193305,60.29948,34200,5.1959,60.30795,34080,5.19771,60.31538,33960,5.19723,60.32281,33840,5.19466,60.33007,33720,5.19096,60.33452,33600,5.17922,60.33865,33360,5.16902,60.35019,33240,5.168408,60.35722,33120,5.16737,60.36357,33000,5.166039,60.37119,32880,5.16688,60.37767,32700,5.177245,60.38391,32520,5.19786,60.39124,32400,5.212755,60.39609,32280,5.226553,60.40044,32160,5.240568,60.40311,31980,5.257174,60.40203,31800,5.278433,60.39992,31620,5.295588,60.39516,31440,5.30641,60.39054,31260,5.30973,60.38969,30120,5.31023,60.38949,28800,5.310214,60.38948,27540,5.310214,60.38948,26280,5.310214,60.38948,26280,5.310214,60.38948,25020,5.310214,60.38948,23760,5.310214,60.38946,22500,5.31023,60.38948,21180,5.31023,60.38948,19920,5.310246,60.38948,18660,5.31023,60.38948,17400,5.31023,60.38948,16140,5.310232,60.38948,14880,5.310248,60.38948,13620,5.310232,60.38946,12300,5.310232,60.38946,11040,5.310246,60.38948,9780,5.31023,60.38948,8520,5.31023,60.38948,7260,5.31023,60.38948,6000,5.310214,60.38949,4560,5.31023,60.38948,3240,5.31023,60.38948,1620,5.310214,60.38948,360,5.31023,60.38948]},{"name":"DAWDLE","text":"DAWDLE:To

Europa was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei[1] and was named after Europa, daughter of the king of Tyre, who became one of Zeus' lovers. Progressively better observations of Europa have occurred over the centuries by Earth-bound telescopes, and by space probe flybys starting in the 1970s.\n\nSlightly smaller than the Moon, Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust[10] and probably an iron–nickel core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, whereas craters are relatively rare. It has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System.[11] The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life.[12] This hypothesis proposes that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives geological activity similar to plate tectonics.[13] On 8 September 2014, NASA reported finding evidence supporting earlier suggestions of plate tectonics in Europa's thick ice shell—the first sign of such geological activity on a world other than Earth.[14] On 12 May 2015, scientists announced that sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable for life.[15]\n\nIn December 2013, NASA reported the detection of \"clay-like minerals\" (specifically, phyllosilicates), often associated with \"organic material\" on the icy crust of Europa.[16] In addition, NASA announced, based on studies with the Hubble Space Telescope, that water vapor plumes were detected on Europa and were similar to water vapor plumes detected on Enceladus, moon of Saturn.[17]\n\nThe Galileo mission, launched in 1989, provided the bulk of current data on Europa. No spacecraft has yet landed on Europa, but its intriguing characteristics have led to several ambitious exploration proposals. The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is a mission to Europa that is due to launch in 2022.[18] NASA's planned Europa Clipper mission will be launched in the mid-2020s.","path":[82260,5.999078,59.98488,61440,6.000168,59.98449,56700,5.939209,59.99729,56580,5.935185,59.99687,56400,5.931712,59.99648,56280,5.928058,59.99541,56100,5.924913,59.99454,55980,5.921319,59.99348,55860,5.918602,59.99249,55680,5.914907,59.99131,55440,5.908068,59.98878,55260,5.904083,59.98724,55140,5.900728,59.98595,54960,5.895643,59.98401,54600,5.888943,59.98133,54300,5.883554,59.97928,54180,5.88172,59.97864,53220,5.866342,59.97335,52980,5.861073,59.97171,52380,5.84815,59.96849,50940,5.815832,59.96832,50760,5.811183,59.96833,49800,5.788388,59.96822,49440,5.781074,59.96842,48720,5.765082,59.96945,48420,5.759841,59.97032,48300,5.758077,59.97089,48120,5.756902,59.97126,47940,5.75584,59.97157,47820,5.753662,59.97198,47580,5.746947,59.97284,47400,5.742362,59.97418,47160,5.738937,59.97815,46980,5.73673,59.98081,46800,5.734587,59.98341,46680,5.734505,59.98432,46500,5.734495,59.9845,46260,5.734408,59.98495,46140,5.734221,59.98523,45780,5.73377,59.98625,45480,5.733598,59.98735,45240,5.733085,59.98829,45000,5.73257,59.98936,44700,5.731898,59.99033,44460,5.730898,59.99107,44340,5.730078,59.99168,44160,5.729195,59.99233,44040,5.72842,59.99304,43920,5.727577,59.99387,43620,5.725657,59.99585,43380,5.72339,59.99737,43200,5.722387,59.99803,43080,5.721704,59.99863,42900,5.721297,59.99937,42720,5.720858,60.00006,42480,5.720173,60.0017,42360,5.71981,60.00327,42240,5.719372,60.00585,42120,5.718389,60.00911,41880,5.716681,60.01494,41760,5.715889,60.01863,41580,5.71512,60.02183,41400,5.713735,60.02611,41100,5.710989,60.03281,40920,5.7086,60.03689,40560,5.705438,60.04509,40380,5.705477,60.0491,36900,5.58408,60.09683,36540,5.571955,60.09738,36360,5.564452,60.0977,36240,5.558609,60.09799,36060,5.552475,60.0982,35880,5.543208,60.09828,35760,5.53611,60.09853,35580,5.527777,60.09857,35460,5.520628,60.09851,35340,5.514843,60.09862,35220,5.50911,60.09879,35100,5.50328,60.09897,34980,5.49739,60.09902,34860,5.49289,60.09906,34740,5.48714,60.09918,34620,5.48081,60.09929,34500,5.47526,60.09928,34380,5.46863,60.09937,34260,5.46309,60.09947,34140,5.45613,60.0996,34020,5.44826,60.09982,33840,5.43581,60.10108,33600,5.42253,60.10326,33360,5.4096,60.10522,33120,5.397155,60.10703,33000,5.389212,60.10839,32880,5.383237,60.11003,32760,5.377458,60.11155,32640,5.371171,60.11312,32520,5.364588,60.11488,32340,5.357038,60.11681,32160,5.34807,60.12032,31980,5.339873,60.12437,31800,5.332265,60.12823,31620,5.323524,60.13218,31440,5.31696,60.13551,31260,5.308687,60.13955,31080,5.301927,60.14307,30960,5.296699,60.1458,30840,5.291762,60.14833,30600,5.283568,60.15267,30420,5.276538,60.15628,30240,5.270325,60.15939,30060,5.264703,60.16248,29880,5.259268,60.16597,29760,5.254863,60.16836,29520,5.249017,60.17167,29400,5.244312,60.17388,29220,5.239533,60.17617,29040,5.233829,60.179,28860,5.228112,60.18187,28680,5.221467,60.18521,28500,5.215647,60.18811,28320,5.209806,60.191,28200,5.205408,60.19293,28080,5.202436,60.19428,27900,5.199993,60.1956,27720,5.197265,60.19721,27480,5.191938,60.20043,27360,5.188282,60.20288,27120,5.182766,60.20666,26940,5.177735,60.21028,26820,5.173947,60.21407,26700,5.170365,60.21756,26520,5.165815,60.22223,26340,5.16049,60.22769,26160,5.155835,60.23303,26040,5.153192,60.23697,25920,5.151908,60.24064,25800,5.15176,60.24431,25680,5.15266,60.24809,25560,5.154294,60.25154,25380,5.156725,60.25582,25200,5.159613,60.26123,25080,5.163047,60.26483,24960,5.166039,60.26762,24780,5.171576,60.27163,24540,5.179873,60.27666,24420,5.185822,60.28033,24300,5.189128,60.28385,24180,5.190425,60.28679,24060,5.192062,60.29029,23940,5.19372,60.29377,23820,5.195285,60.29756,23700,5.19664,60.30217,23580,5.19709,60.30519,23340,5.197597,60.31143,23220,5.197985,60.3158,23100,5.198277,60.32021,22980,5.197052,60.32399,22860,5.1953,60.32765,22620,5.190068,60.33419,22500,5.184477,60.33693,22320,5.177872,60.33925,22200,5.17169,60.34293,22080,5.169485,60.34753,21900,5.168714,60.35367,21780,5.168915,60.35838,21660,5.169055,60.36283,21480,5.166308,60.36908,21360,5.164402,60.37314,21240,5.165768,60.3771,21120,5.170553,60.3804,21000,5.176147,60.38351,20820,5.183838,60.38667,20640,5.195072,60.39064,20520,5.203957,60.39347,20400,5.21046,60.39556,20160,5.222695,60.39949,20040,5.231202,60.40165,19920,5.239382,60.4031,19800,5.247571,60.40359,19680,5.256568,60.40405,19560,5.264226,60.40442,19440,5.271745,60.4045,19320,5.27935,60.40446,19200,5.287199,60.40437,19080,5.294343,60.40379,18960,5.301132,60.4027,18840,5.306805,60.40159,18660,5.311723,60.40069,18480,5.313513,60.39828,18000,5.31336,60.39788,16680,5.313344,60.39788,15060,5.313352,60.39788,13740,5.313355,60.39789,12420,5.313362,60.39789,11160,5.313355,60.39789,9900,5.313313,60.39804,8580,5.313372,60.39789,7140,5.313372,60.39789,5880,5.313358,60.3979,4560,5.31337,60.39789,3300,5.31337,60.39789,1800,5.313345,60.3979,420,5.313362,60.39789]},{"name":"BEAGLE","text":"BEAGLE:The Beagle is a breed of small to medium-sized dog. A member of the hound group, it is similar in appearance to the foxhound, but smaller with shorter legs and longer, softer ears. Beagles are scent hounds, developed primarily for tracking hare, rabbit, deer, and other small game. They have a great sense of smell and tracking instinct that sees them employed as detection dogs for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. Beagles are intelligent but single-minded, and popular pets because of their size, even temper, and lack of inherited health problems.Although beagle-type dogs have existed for 2,500 years, the modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings, and more recently in film, television, and comic books. Snoopy of the comic strip Peanuts has been promoted as \"the world's most famous beagle\".[1]Dogs of similar size and purpose to the modern Beagle[a] can be traced in Ancient Greece[2] back to around the 5th century BC. Xenophon, born around 430 BC, in his Treatise on Hunting or Cynegeticus refers to a hound that hunted hares by scent and was followed on foot. Small hounds are mentioned in the Forest Laws of Canute which exempted them from the ordinance which commanded that all dogs capable of running down a stag should have one foot mutilated.[3] If genuine, these laws would confirm that beagle-type dogs were present in England before 1016, but it is likely the laws were written in the Middle Ages to give a sense of antiquity and tradition to Forest Law.[4]In the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought the Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound derived from the St. Hubert Hound which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed.[5] Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably gave rise to the Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day Beagle.[b]From medieval times, beagle was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood 8 to 9 inches (20 to 23 cm) at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a \"pocket\" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups.[6] 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's Researches into the History of the British Dog from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the Beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the:little small mitten-beagle, which may be companion for a ladies kirtle, and in the field will run as cunningly as any hound whatere, only their musick is very small like reeds.[7]Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.[8]By the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit: the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the River Trent and probably closely related to the Talbot Hound. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed.[9] As fox hunting became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern Foxhound. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small rabbit-hunting packs.Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a Beagle pack in Essex in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern Beagle breed. Although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded it is thought that North Country Beagles and Southern Hounds were strongly represented; William Youatt suspected that Harriers formed a good majority of the Beagle's bloodline, but the origin of the Harrier is itself obscure.[10] Honeywood's Beagles were small, standing at about 10 inches (25 cm) at the shoulder, and pure white according to John Mills (writing in The Sportsman's Library in 1845). Prince Albert and Lord Winterton also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favour no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three.[11]Although credited with the development of the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated Beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard Beagle bloodline.[12]In the 1840s, a standard Beagle type was beginning to develop; the distinction between the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound had been lost, but there was still a large variation in size, character, and reliability among the emerging packs.[13] In 1856, \"Stonehenge\" (the pseudonym of John Henry Walsh), writing in the Manual of British Rural Sports, was still dividing Beagles into four varieties: the medium Beagle; the dwarf or lapdog Beagle; the fox Beagle (a smaller, slower version of the Foxhound); and the rough-coated or terrier Beagle, which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the Scottish terrier breeds.[14] Stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description:In size the beagle measures from 10 inches, or even less, to 15. In shape they resemble the old southern hound in miniature, but with more neatness and beauty; and they also resemble that hound in style of hunting.[14]By 1887 the threat of extinction was on the wane: there were 18 Beagle packs in England.[15] The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn up at the same time.[16] The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of Beagle.[17] By 1902, the number of packs had risen to 44.[15]Beagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest, but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887.[18] The Beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885.[19] In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles took over the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896.[16] The regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type, and the Beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by World War II, the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.[20]As purebred dogs, Beagles have always been more popular in the United States and Canada than in their native country England. The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a Beagle had won a Best in Show title. As in the UK, activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased. In 1928 it won a number of prizes at the Westminster Kennel Club's show and by 1939 a Beagle – Champion Meadowlark Draughtsman – had captured the title of top-winning American-bred dog for the year.[21] On 12 February 2008, a Beagle, K-Run's Park Me In First (Uno), won the Best In Show category at the Westminster Kennel Club show for the first time in the competition's history.[22] In North America they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for over 30 years. From 1953 to 1959 the Beagle was ranked No. 1 on the list of the American Kennel Club's registered breeds;[23] in 2005 and 2006 it ranked 5th out of the 155 breeds registered.[24] In the UK they are not quite so popular, placing 28th and 30th in the rankings of registrations with the Kennel Club in 2005 and 2006 respectively.[25] In the United States the Beagle ranked 4th most popular breed in 2012 and 2013, behind the Labrador Retriever (#1), German Shepherd (#2) and Golden Retriever (#3) breeds.[26]According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first mention of the beagle by name in English literature dates from ca. 1475 in \"The Squire of Low Degree. The origin of the word \"beagle\" is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the word derives from the French begueule (meaning \"open throat\" from bayer \"open wide\" and gueule \"mouth\")[27] or from an Old English, French, or the Gaelic word beag, meaning \"little.\" Other possibilities include the French beugler (meaning \"to bellow\") and the German begele (meaning \"to scold\").It is not known why the black and tan Kerry Beagle, present in Ireland since Celtic times, has the beagle description, since at 22 to 24 inches (56 to 61 cm) it is significantly taller than the modern day Beagle, and in earlier times was even larger. Some writers suggest that the Beagle's scenting ability may have come from cross-breeding earlier strains with the Kerry Beagle. Originally used for hunting stags, it is today used for hare and drag hunting.The general appearance of the Beagle resembles a miniature Foxhound, but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body.[28] They are generally between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm) high at the withers and weigh between 18 and 35 lb (8.2 and 15.9 kg), with females being slightly smaller than males on average.[29]They have a smooth, somewhat domed skull with a medium-length, square-cut muzzle and a black (or occasionally liver) gumdrop nose. The jaw is strong and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw. The eyes are large, hazel or brown, with a mild hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a dewlap; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered abdomen and waist and a long, slightly curved tail (known as the \"stern\") tipped with white. The white tip, known as the flag has been selectively bred for, as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent.[30] The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The Beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the stifles.[31]Beagles appear in a range of colors. Although the tricolour (white with large black areas and light brown shading) is the most common, Beagles can occur in any hound colour.Tricoloured dogs occur in a number of shades, from the \"Classic Tri\" with a jet black saddle (also known as \"Blackback\"), to the \"Dark Tri\" (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the \"Faded Tri\" (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings). Some tricoloured dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as pied. These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair. Tricolour Beagles are almost always born black and white. The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures. (The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some Beagles gradually change colour during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely.Two-colour varieties always have a white base colour with areas of the second colour. Tan and white is the most common two-colour variety, but there is a wide range of other colours including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different coloured flecks (ticking), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick Beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue colour, similar to the colouring of the Bluetick Coonhound. Some tricolour Beagles also have ticking of various colours in their white areas.[32][33]Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the Beagle has one of the best developed senses of smell of any dog.[34] In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behaviour. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The Beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favour of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable.[34] The long ears and large lips of the Beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.[35]The American Kennel Club recognizes two separate varieties of Beagle: the 13-inch for hounds less than 13 inches (33 cm), and the 15-inch for those between 13 and 15 inches (33 and 38 cm). The Canadian Kennel Club recognizes a single type, with a height not exceeding 15 inches (38 cm). The Kennel Club (UK) and FCI affiliated clubs recognize a single type, with a height of between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm).English and American varieties are sometimes mentioned. However, there is no official recognition from any Kennel Club for this distinction. Beagles fitting the American Kennel Club standard – which disallows animals over 15 inches (38 cm) – are smaller on average than those fitting the Kennel Club standard which allows heights up to 16 inches (41 cm).Pocket Beagles are sometimes advertised for sale but the bloodline for this variety is extinct, and, although the UK Kennel Club originally specified a standard for the Pocket Beagle in 1901, the variety is not now recognised by any Kennel Club. Often, small Beagles are the result of poor breeding or dwarfism.[8]A strain known as Patch Hounds was developed by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do not necessarily have a patchwork marking.[36][37]In the 1850s, Stonehenge recommended a cross between a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He found the crossbreed to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.[38]More recently the trend has been for \"designer dogs\" and one of the most popular has been the Beagle/Pug cross known as a Puggle. Less excitable than a Beagle and with a lower exercise requirement, these dogs are suited to city dwelling.[39]The Beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition. Described in several breed standards as \"merry\", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this depends on the individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor guard dogs for this reason, although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the Beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the Yorkshire Terrier, Cairn Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, West Highland White Terrier, and Fox Terrier.[40][c]Beagles are intelligent but, as a result of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.[41][42]Beagles are excellent with children and this is one of the reasons they have become popular family pets, but they are pack animals, and can be prone to separation anxiety.[43] Not all Beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as \"speaking\", \"giving tongue\", or \"opening\") when they catch the scent of potential quarry.[44] They also generally get along well with other dogs. They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest. Regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone.[45]The typical longevity of Beagles is 12–15 years,[46] which is a common lifespan for dogs of their size.[47]Beagles may be prone to epilepsy, but this can often be controlled with medication. Hypothyroidism and a number of types of dwarfism occur in Beagles. Two conditions in particular are unique to the breed: \"Funny Puppy\", in which the puppy is slow to develop and eventually develops weak legs, a crooked back and although normally healthy, is prone to a range of illnesses;[48] Hip dysplasia, common in Harriers and in some larger breeds, is rarely considered a problem in Beagles.[49] Beagles are considered a chondrodystrophic breed, meaning that they are prone to types of disk diseases.[50]In rare cases, Beagles may develop immune mediated polygenic arthritis (where the immune system attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments.[48] Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.[51][52]Their long floppy ears can mean that the inner ear does not receive a substantial air flow or that moist air becomes trapped, and this can lead to ear infections. Beagles may also be affected by a range of eye problems; two common ophthalmic conditions in Beagles are glaucoma and corneal dystrophy.[53] \"Cherry eye\", a prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid, and distichiasis, a condition in which eyelashes grow into the eye causing irritation, sometimes exist; both these conditions can be corrected with surgery.[48] They can suffer from several types of retinal atrophy. Failure of the nasolacrimal drainage system can cause dry eye or leakage of tears onto the face.[48]As field dogs they are prone to minor injuries such as cuts and sprains, and, if inactive, obesity is a common problem as they will eat whenever food is available and rely on their owners to regulate their weight.[48] When working or running free they are also likely to pick up parasites such as fleas, ticks, harvest mites, and tapeworms, and irritants such as grass seeds can become trapped in their eyes, soft ears, or paws.[54]Beagles may exhibit a behaviour known as reverse sneezing, in which they sound as if they are choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it is not harmful to the dog.Beagles were developed primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as beagling. They were seen as ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who could not afford to maintain a stable of good hunting horses.[55] Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny Beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The Beagle packs would run closely together (\"so close that they might be covered with a sheet\"[10]) which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant.[56]With the fashion for faster hunts, the Beagle fell out of favour for chasing hare, but was still employed for rabbit hunting. In Anecdotes of Dogs (1846), Edward Jesse says:In rabbit-shooting, in gorse and thick cover, nothing can be more cheerful than the beagle. They also are easily heard over long distances and in thick cover. They have been called rabbit-beagles from this employment, for which they are peculiarly qualified, especially those dogs which are somewhat wire-haired.[6]In the United States they appear to have been employed chiefly for hunting rabbits from the earliest imports. Hunting hare with Beagles became popular again in Britain in the mid-19th century and continued until it was made illegal in Scotland by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004. Under this legislation Beagles may still pursue rabbits with the landowner's permission. Drag hunting is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who do not wish to participate in hunting a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.The traditional foot pack consists of up to 40 Beagles, marshalled by a Huntsman who directs the pack and who is assisted by a variable number of whippers-in whose job is to return straying hounds to the pack. The Master of the Hunt is in overall day-to-day charge of the pack, and may or may not take on the role of Huntsman on the day of the hunt.As hunting with Beagles was seen as ideal for young people, many of the British public schools traditionally maintained Beagle packs. Protests were lodged against Eton's use of Beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today,[57] and a pack used by Imperial College in Wye, Kent was stolen by the Animal Liberation Front in 2001.[58] School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, Marlborough, Wye, Radley, the Royal Agricultural University and Christ Church, Oxford.[59]In addition to organized beagling, beagles have been used for hunting or flushing to guns (often in pairs) a wide range of game including Snowshoe Hare, Cottontail rabbits, game birds, Roe Deer, Red Deer, Bobcat, Coyote, Wild Boar and foxes, and have even been recorded as being used to hunt Stoat.[60][61] In most of these cases, the Beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns.[60]Beagles are used as detection dogs in the Beagle Brigade of the United States Department of Agriculture. These dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the United States. After trialling several breeds, Beagles were chosen because they are relatively small and unintimidating for people who are uncomfortable around dogs, easy to care for, intelligent and work well for rewards.[62] They are also used for this purpose in a number of other countries including by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in New Zealand, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and in Canada, Japan and the People's Republic of China.[63] Larger breeds are generally used for detection of explosives as this often involves climbing over luggage and on large conveyor belts, work for which the smaller Beagle is not suited.[64]Beagles are the dog breed most often used in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used in a range of research procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment.[65][66] Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were Beagles (97.3%).[67] In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved.[68] In 2005 Beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved Beagles (96.6%).[65] Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.[68]Testing of cosmetic products on animals is banned in the member states of European Community,[69] although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted.[70] It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[71] When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses Beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing.[72] Minnesota was the first state to enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed with research testing.[73]Anti-vivisection groups have reported on abuse of animals inside testing facilities. In 1997 footage secretly filmed by a freelance journalist inside Huntingdon Life Sciences in the UK showed staff punching and screaming at Beagles.[74] Consort Kennels, a UK-based breeder of Beagles for testing, closed down in 1997 after pressure from animal rights groups.[75]Although bred for hunting, Beagles are versatile and are nowadays employed for various other roles in detection, therapy, and as family pets.[30] Beagles are used as sniffer dogs for termite detection in Australia,[76] and have been mentioned as possible candidates for drug and explosive detection.[77][78] Because of their gentle nature and unimposing build, they are also frequently used in pet therapy, visiting the sick and elderly in hospital.[79] In June 2006, a trained Beagle assistance dog was credited with saving the life of its owner after using her owner's mobile phone to dial an emergency number.[80] In the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, a Beagle search and rescue dog with a Colombian rescue squad was credited with locating the owner of the Hôtel Montana, who was subsequently rescued after spending 100 hours buried in the rubble.[81]Beagles have been featured across a wide range of media. References to the dog appear before the 19th century in works by such writers as William Shakespeare, John Webster, John Dryden, Thomas Tickell, Henry Fielding, and William Cowper, as well as in Alexander Pope's translation of Homer's Iliad.[d] Beagles appeared in funny animal comic strips and animated cartoons from the 1950s with the Peanuts character Snoopy billed as \"the world's most famous Beagle\";[1] Walt Disney's Beagle Boys; Garfield's friend and \"chew dog\" Odie; and Beegle Beagle, the constant companion of Hanna-Barbera's Grape Ape. They have appeared in numerous films, taking a central role in Underdog, Cats & Dogs and its sequel, and the title role in the adaptation of Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's book Shiloh. They have played supporting roles in films including Audition, The Monster Squad, I Am Number Four, and The Royal Tenenbaums, and on television in Star Trek: Enterprise, EastEnders, The Wonder Years, and To the Manor Born, among others. Former US President Lyndon Baines Johnson had several Beagles, and caused an outcry when he picked up one of them by its ears during an official greeting on the White House lawn.[82] The ship on which Charles Darwin made the voyage which provided much of the inspiration for On the Origin of Species was named HMS Beagle after the breed, and, in turn, lent its name to the ill-fated British Martian lander Beagle 2. A Canadian bred 15 inch female Beagle with the registered name of Gr Ch Tashtins Lookin For Trouble and the pet name of \"Miss P\" won the 2015 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.[83]a. ^ In this article \"Beagle\" (with a capital B) is used to distinguish the modern breed from other beagle-type dogs.b. ^ Youatt states that the Southern Hound may have been native to the British Isles and used on hunts by the Ancient Britons.[84]c. ^ The Harts posed the following question to a panel of 96 experts, half of which were veterinary surgeons and the other half dog obedience trial judges:A dog may normally be quite calm but can become very excitable when set off by such things as a ringing doorbell or an owner's movement toward the door. This characteristic may be very annoying to some people. Rank these seven breeds from least to most excitable.d. ^ The specific references in each of the author's works are as follows: Shakespeare: \"Sir Toby Belch: She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me: what o' that?\" Twelfth Night (c.1600) Act II Scene III Webster: \"Mistress Tenterhook': You are a sweet beagle\" Westward Ho (1607) Act III Scene IV:2 Dryden: \"The rest in shape a beagle's whelp throughout, With broader forehead and a sharper snout\" The Cock and the Fox, and again: \"About her feet were little beagles seen\" in Palamon and Arcite both from Fables, Ancient and Modern (1700) Tickell: \"Here let me trace beneath the purpled morn, The deep-mouth'd beagle, and the sprightly horn\" To a Lady before Marriage (published posthumously in 1749) Fielding: \"'What the devil would you have me do?' cries the Squire, turning to Blifil, 'I can no more turn her, than a beagle can turn an old hare.'\" The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (1749) Chapter 7.

Smidt jun. studied theology in Jena, and was one of the founders of the Gesellschaft der freien Männer (Community of free men). He was ordained Reformed preacher in Zürich in 1797. He then became Professor of History at the Gymnasium illustre in his hometown. He then became 'Syndikus' (company lawyer) for the Älterleute (aldermen, Bremen's merchants corporation of constitutional rank) and in 1800 'Ratsherr' (councilman), a position in which he exerted considerable influence on the governmental and commercial development of the cities of the Hanseatic League.In particular as he acted as Bremen's diplomatic representative at the Congress of Vienna and preserved the independence of the Hanseatic cities and put through their acceptance into the German Confederation of sovereign states after the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. In the final revision of the decisions of the Congress on the rights of the Jews, Smidt - unauthorised and unconsented by the other parties - changed the text from \"The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them in the confederal states\", by replacing a single word, which ensued serious consequences, into: \"The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them by the confederal states.\"[1] In the Confederation's Bundesversammlung, he battled the politics of Klemens Wenzel Lothar von Metternich, and was particularly involved in the negotiations which in 1820 established free shipping on the Weser.Above all, he gave Bremen's commerce an important impulse through the foundation of Bremerhaven in 1827 and by closing advantageous trade agreements with foreign countries, through widening of consular representation, etc. In 1821 he became Bürgermeister of Bremen and he held this post — apart from the democratic period of 1849-1852 — until his death.Smidt was a devout member of the Reformed church, then Bremen's state church, merged only in 1873 with Lutheran congregations to form today's Bremian Evangelical Church. He worked against tolerating other religions and denominations within the city. Inglorius was Smidt's anti-Judaism. As burgomaster, Smidt made the \"complete expulsion of the children of Israel\" an \"urgent concern of the state\" since 1821. Jews had settled within the city during its incorporation into the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia (1807-1810) and afterwards into France (1810-1813), when all inhabitants had become French citizens of equal status. All this ended in 1813/1815. Since it was the French state and not the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, which had emancipated the Jews in Bremen, the city took the altered formulation of the Viennese decisions as the legal grounds to revoke - as did a number of confederal states - the emancipation of the Jews in its territory. In 1826, Smidt had met his goal with the exception of two 'Schutzjuden' taken over from neighbouring Hanover.[1]Also Bremen's Lutheran congregation, owning and using the Bremen Cathedral, experienced Smidt's steady badgering. The cathedral district, a former immunity, used to be an extraterritorial enclave of the neighboured state of Bremen-Verden until 1803, when it was incorporated into the Free Imperial City of Bremen. As burgomaster Smidt confiscated the considerable estates of the Lutheran congregation, arguing it would be a legal non-thing, null and void. The representatives of the Lutheran congregation, led by the cathedral preacher Johann David Nicolai, started to fight for its right to exist. The fight lasted until the congregation's official recognition in 1830, asserted by a majority of Bremen's senators (government members) against the expressed will of Smidt.[2] Smidt abused his governmental power to suppress the Lutheran congregation by way of ordinances, confiscation and public discreditation.Smidt dedicated himself to close cooperation between the Hanseatic cities.

(/ˈdʒʌtlənd/; Danish: Jylland [ˈjylanˀ]; German: Jütland [ˈjyːtlant]), also known as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula (Latin: Cimbricus Chersonesus; Danish: Den Kimbriske Halvø; German: Kimbrische Halbinsel), is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and the northern portion of Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east.Jutland is a peninsula bounded by the North Sea to the west, the Skagerrak to the north, the Kattegat and Baltic Sea to the east and Germany to the south. Geographically and historically, Jutland comprises the regions of South Jutland, West Jutland, East Jutland (including Mols) and North Jutland (including Himmerland, Vendsyssel and Thy). There are several historical subdivisions and regional names, some of which are still occasionally encountered today. They include Nørrejyllland, Sydvestjylland, Nordvestjylland and Slesvig. Politically, Jutland currently comprises the three contemporary Danish Administrative Regions of North Denmark Region, Central Denmark Region and the Region of Southern Denmark, along with portions of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.Historically, Jutland was regulated by the Law Code of Jutland (Jyske Lov). This civic code covered the Jutland Peninsula from the area north of the River Eider to Funen as well as the North Jutlandic Island and other smaller islands.The Danish part of Jutland is currently divided into three administrative regions: North Denmark Region, Central Denmark Region and Region of Southern Denmark.[1] These three regions have a total area of 29,775 km2 (11,496 sq mi), a population of 2,599,104 (2016)[2] and a population density of 84 per km2 (218 per sq.mi.).The northernmost part of Jutland is separated from the mainland by the Limfjord, a narrow stretch of water which bisects the peninsula from coast to coast following a flood in 1825.[3] This area is called the North Jutlandic Island, Vendsyssel-Thy (after its districts) or simply Jutland north of the Limfjord; it is only partly co-terminous with the North Jutland region.The islands of Læsø, Anholt and Samsø in Kattegat and Als at the rim of the Baltic Sea South are administratively and historically tied to Jutland although the latter two are also regarded as traditional districts of their own. Inhabitants of Als would agree to be South Jutlanders, but not necessarily Jutlanders.[citation needed]The Danish Wadden Sea Islands and the German North Frisian Islands stretch along the southwest coast of Jutland in the German Bight.Jutland has historically been one of the three lands of Denmark, the other two being Scania and Zealand. Before that, according to Ptolemy, Jutland or the Cimbric Chersonese was the home of Teutons, Cimbri and Charudes.Many Angles, Saxons and Jutes migrated from Continental Europe to Great Britain starting in c. 450 AD. The Angles themselves gave their name to the new emerging kingdoms called England (i.e., \"Angle-land\"). This is thought by some[who?] to be related to the invasion of Europe by the Huns from Asia.Saxons and Frisii migrated to the region in the early part of the Christian era. To protect themselves from invasion by the Christian Frankish emperors, the Danes built the Danevirke, a wall stretching across South Jutland from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea, beginning in the 8th century.The pagan Saxons inhabited the southernmost part of the peninsula at the Baltic Sea until the Saxon Wars in 772-804 AD in the Nordic Iron Age, when Charlemagne violently subdued them and forced them to be Christianised. Old Saxony was politically absorbed into the Carolingian Empire and Abodrites (or Obotrites), a group of Wendish Slavs who pledged allegiance to Charlemagne and who had for the most part converted to Christianity, was moved into the area to populate it.[citation needed] Old Saxony was later on referred to as Holstein.To speed transit between the Baltic and the North Sea, canals have been built across the peninsula, notably the Eiderkanal in the late 18th century and the Kiel Canal, completed in 1895 and still in use.During the First World War, the Battle of Jutland in the North Sea west of Jutland was one of the largest naval battles in history. In this pitched battle, the British Royal Navy engaged the Imperial German Navy leading to heavy casualties and losses of ships on both sides. The British fleet sustained greater losses, but remained in control of the North Sea, so in strategic terms, most historians regard Jutland either as a British victory or as indecisive.[4]The distinctive Jutish (or Jutlandic) dialects differ substantially from standard Danish, especially West Jutlandic and South Jutlandic. Dialect usage, although in decline, is better preserved in Jutland than in eastern Denmark, and Jutlander speech remains a stereotype among many Copenhageners and eastern Danes.The largest cities in the Danish section of Jutland are as follows:Aarhus, Silkeborg, Billund, Randers, Kolding, Horsens, Vejle, Fredericia and Haderslev, along with a number of smaller towns, make up the East Jutland metropolitan area.Administratively, Danish Jutland comprises three of Denmark's five regions, namely the Region Nordjylland, Region Midtjylland and the western half of Region of Southern Denmark, which includes Funen. The five administrative regions came into effect on 1 January 2007, following a structural reform.[5]The southern third of the Jutland peninsula is made up of the German Bundesland of Schleswig-Holstein. Schleswig-Holstein has two parts: the former duchies of Schleswig (Danish fief) and Holstein (German fief), both of which have passed back and forth between Danish and German rulers several times. The last adjustment of the Danish–German border followed the Schleswig Plebiscites in 1920 and resulted in Denmark's regaining Northern Schleswig (Danish: Nordslesvig or more commonly today: Sønderjylland).The historical southern border of Jutland is the River Eider, which is also the border between the former duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, as well as the historical border between the Danish and German realms from c. 800 to 1864. Although most of Schleswig-Holstein is geographically part of the Jutland peninsula, most German residents there would not identify themselves with Jutland or even as \"Jutlanders\", but rather with North Germany (German: Norddeutschland) and Schleswig-Holstein, considering themselves Northern Germans (German: Norddeutsche) and Schleswig-Holsteiner.The medieval Code of Jutland applied for Schleswig until 1900 when it was replaced by the Prussian Civil Code. Some rarely used clauses of the Jutlandic Code still apply north of the Eider, but not south of the Eider.[citation needed]The largest cities in the German part of Jutland or the Jutland Peninsula are Hamburg, Kiel, Lübeck, Flensburg and Neumünster.","path":[82140,8.72933,53.12175,80880,8.729326,53.12179,79620,8.729293,53.12174,78360,8.72935,53.12175,77100,8.729362,53.12169,75900,8.72929,53.12168,75600,8.728877,53.12117,75480,8.728378,53.12057,75360,8.727576,53.12034,75180,8.726178,53.12039,75060,8.724049,53.12061,74880,8.719457,53.1207,74760,8.716918,53.12055,74460,8.711262,53.12015,74100,8.710462,53.12001,72780,8.710475,53.12002,72360,8.708332,53.11997,72120,8.703036,53.11999,71940,8.697964,53.12013,71700,8.691625,53.12053,71580,8.687058,53.12112,71340,8.680527,53.12245,71220,8.674768,53.12359,71100,8.668473,53.12486,70920,8.65882,53.12624,70800,8.649863,53.12752,70500,8.635025,53.13548,70380,8.630192,53.14077,70260,8.62743,53.14669,70080,8.626097,53.15376,69900,8.624987,53.16023,69720,8.618508,53.16781,69600,8.608543,53.17064,69240,8.585207,53.17251,69060,8.573736,53.1757,62640,8.493849,53.40976,62520,8.493156,53.41551,62100,8.490915,53.43091,61920,8.490005,53.43907,61440,8.489767,53.45615,61320,8.490481,53.46228,61080,8.491828,53.47051,60900,8.490294,53.47447,60660,8.490062,53.47463,60360,8.4906,53.4746,58980,8.490162,53.47462,57540,8.489933,53.47589,55920,8.49111,53.47627,54660,8.49101,53.47631,52860,8.490842,53.47626,50880,8.490907,53.4763,49440,8.491023,53.47624,48180,8.49105,53.47621,46920,8.491055,53.47626,45660,8.491052,53.47622,44400,8.490972,53.47625,42960,8.490985,53.47626,41700,8.490808,53.47644,40440,8.490985,53.47645,39120,8.490818,53.47651,38940,8.490262,53.47664,38760,8.490695,53.47663,38580,8.490335,53.47659,38400,8.49034,53.47651,38220,8.49068,53.4764,37500,8.490521,53.47626,37320,8.490067,53.47618,36780,8.489728,53.47612,35340,8.489855,53.47606,34080,8.488446,53.47567,33900,8.488315,53.47523,33720,8.488579,53.47474,32280,8.490035,53.47413,30840,8.489482,53.47401,29580,8.489603,53.47398,28320,8.489787,53.47397,27060,8.490006,53.47403,25620,8.489777,53.47407,24360,8.489819,53.47402,23100,8.490035,53.47401,21840,8.489833,53.474,20580,8.489735,53.47397,20400,8.489573,53.47444,20220,8.48974,53.47484,20100,8.489787,53.47467,19980,8.49026,53.47454,19740,8.493651,53.4754,19560,8.494518,53.47884,19380,8.495584,53.48298,19260,8.497573,53.48683,19080,8.500412,53.49085,18960,8.503734,53.49465,18840,8.507274,53.49819,18660,8.511352,53.50173,18540,8.515634,53.50492,18360,8.521087,53.50777,18240,8.527001,53.51065,18000,8.534302,53.51402,17880,8.539832,53.51631,17700,8.545022,53.51834,17580,8.550727,53.52037,17460,8.556033,53.5223,17220,8.562531,53.526,17100,8.565427,53.52975,16920,8.566912,53.53438,16800,8.56601,53.538,16620,8.562741,53.54218,16500,8.55882,53.54637,16320,8.55507,53.55051,16200,8.55044,53.55511,16020,8.545078,53.5604,15900,8.540967,53.56464,15720,8.536305,53.56939,15600,8.531979,53.57388,15420,8.527237,53.57889,15300,8.522815,53.58363,15060,8.515928,53.59032,14940,8.51074,53.59443,14700,8.502153,53.60072,14580,8.496821,53.60516,14400,8.489977,53.61017,14220,8.481885,53.61489,14100,8.473588,53.61899,13920,8.465168,53.62309,13800,8.457375,53.62629,13620,8.449146,53.6298,13500,8.441395,53.63304,13320,8.433287,53.63642,13200,8.425085,53.63988,13020,8.416883,53.64328,12900,8.40933,53.64649,12780,8.403127,53.65017,12600,8.396744,53.65475,12420,8.388688,53.66012,12300,8.381415,53.66491,12120,8.374173,53.66977,11940,8.367162,53.67441,11760,8.358875,53.68002,11640,8.351035,53.68559,11460,8.34313,53.69097,11280,8.336298,53.69514,11160,8.327532,53.69843,11040,8.31931,53.70149,10860,8.310313,53.7049,10740,8.301452,53.70845,10620,8.295287,53.7108,10500,8.287189,53.71384,10320,8.2772,53.71767,10140,8.26623,53.72183,9900,8.250452,53.72912,9660,8.233722,53.73731,9480,8.225115,53.74155,9180,8.205281,53.75098,9060,8.199195,53.75371,6240,8.112494,53.83138,5820,8.116233,53.84526,5700,8.116468,53.84879,5520,8.116411,53.85477,5400,8.116175,53.86041,4800,8.09688,53.8771,4560,8.087303,53.87946,4440,8.079925,53.8813,4260,8.072063,53.88349,4140,8.065376,53.88565,3960,8.058415,53.88811,3840,8.050569,53.89103,3660,8.044269,53.89354,3480,8.036965,53.89749,3300,8.030252,53.90154,3180,8.025086,53.90454,3060,8.021212,53.90796,2940,8.020984,53.91137,2820,8.021978,53.91552,2700,8.025537,53.91951,2580,8.02959,53.92335,2460,8.034106,53.92703,2340,8.039733,53.93123,2160,8.045787,53.93538,2040,8.052339,53.93972,1920,8.057665,53.94321,1740,8.065402,53.94826,1560,8.073662,53.95362,1380,8.080947,53.96046,1140,8.080827,53.96893,960,8.080303,53.97632,780,8.079741,53.9836,600,8.078917,53.99087,420,8.077945,53.99792,180,8.082097,54.00359,60,8.090794,54.00407]},{"name":"LENA","text":"LENA:Leading European Newspaper Alliance (LENA) is an organisation set up by seven European newspapers in March 2015, to improve journalism in Europe. The group aims to share content and technology practice within the transformation the journalism industry is currently experiencing, in an environment characterised by rapid growth in Internet-based readers. The members of LENA are Die Welt (Germany), El País (Spain), La Repubblica (Italy), Le Figaro (France), Le Soir (Belgium), Swiss German-language newspaper Tages-Anzeiger and French-language newspaper Tribune de Genève.[1] These publications have a joint readership of seven million, in addition to 43 million unique Internet users.[2] Javier Moreno Barber, editor in-chief of El País from 2006 to 2014, is the group's director.[3]The initiative is intended to consolidate European public opinion through content that the seven members of LENA share and produce jointly. This includes exchanging journalists and other employees. The seven newspapers share new practices and digital techniques in technology, trade and publishing. Each newspaper submits selected articles to a shared platform, where members can select the ones they believe to be of greatest interest to their readers, to increase dissemination of content like interviews, reports and opinion articles, written by experts, academics and public figures from different disciplines.As part of its strategy, LENA promotes and organizes international events in Europe. In January 2016, as part of the World Economic Forum, held in Davos, LENA organized a debate on the challenges represented by integrating refugees. Issues for which LENA members have worked jointly include refugees of the Syrian Civil War, the Greek government-debt crisis, the political challenges of the EU and the consequences of economic sanctions on Russia.","path":[81240,8.858885,53.05941,79980,8.858875,53.05939,78720,8.858882,53.05937,77460,8.858891,53.05938,76200,8.858858,53.05939,74940,8.8589,53.05939,74760,8.858104,53.05961,74520,8.852761,53.0597,74340,8.847495,53.05921,74220,8.841766,53.0603,73980,8.835763,53.06502,73860,8.831373,53.06747,73680,8.823727,53.06789,73560,8.817133,53.06871,73380,8.810445,53.07056,73260,8.804267,53.07333,73020,8.797033,53.07823,72900,8.790381,53.08035,72720,8.783796,53.08148,72600,8.776258,53.0831,72360,8.766887,53.08767,72060,8.759125,53.09593,71880,8.753767,53.09981,71640,8.745625,53.10569,71280,8.733738,53.11439,71100,8.725825,53.11668,70920,8.713794,53.11802,70620,8.698163,53.1185,70500,8.6901,53.11965,70320,8.681802,53.12153,70080,8.670208,53.12431,69960,8.661815,53.12571,69720,8.650066,53.12693,69600,8.64215,53.12964,69360,8.634035,53.1352,69180,8.62996,53.14022,69000,8.627202,53.14642,68700,8.625422,53.15727,68400,8.618662,53.16766,68280,8.611571,53.16988,67980,8.595257,53.1713,58740,8.492316,53.47373,58320,8.493752,53.48571,57480,8.494148,53.48859,56160,8.494123,53.48862,54360,8.494125,53.48861,53160,8.494125,53.48862,51900,8.494145,53.48862,50100,8.49414,53.48863,48840,8.494153,53.48862,47580,8.494117,53.48863,46320,8.494143,53.48861,45060,8.494132,53.48863,43740,8.494222,53.48865,43620,8.494918,53.48864,43440,8.494342,53.48777,43260,8.494561,53.48481,43140,8.495773,53.48131,43020,8.494965,53.47576,42780,8.493201,53.46538,42600,8.49221,53.4584,42480,8.491272,53.45096,42300,8.491683,53.44353,42180,8.492496,53.43557,42000,8.493513,53.428,41820,8.494462,53.4201,41700,8.49544,53.41279,41580,8.4962,53.40601,41400,8.497131,53.39927,41280,8.497913,53.39215,41100,8.498585,53.38459,40920,8.499165,53.37671,40800,8.500058,53.37,40620,8.501505,53.36276,40440,8.502625,53.35554,40320,8.502287,53.34875,40200,8.499844,53.3426,39960,8.494752,53.33467,39840,8.491023,53.32851,39720,8.489763,53.32303,39540,8.490742,53.31473,39360,8.491565,53.3087,39240,8.492615,53.30227,31740,8.741977,53.1104,31260,8.76049,53.09521,31080,8.764475,53.09072,30960,8.769604,53.08617,30720,8.780897,53.08198,30180,8.808126,53.07155,30000,8.815865,53.06896,29880,8.826302,53.06789,29700,8.834197,53.06639,29580,8.838351,53.06222,29460,8.845233,53.05931,29280,8.854428,53.0598,29160,8.861564,53.0591,28620,8.862615,53.05897,28020,8.867811,53.05801,27900,8.872753,53.05725,27720,8.872327,53.05873,27000,8.872412,53.05876,25740,8.872395,53.05873,24480,8.872416,53.05877,23220,8.872425,53.05877,21960,8.872416,53.0588,20520,8.872388,53.05877,19260,8.872401,53.05878,18000,8.872415,53.0588,16740,8.872405,53.05877,15300,8.872401,53.05877,14040,8.872435,53.05875,12780,8.872394,53.05877,11520,8.872416,53.05877,10260,8.872438,53.05882,8820,8.872434,53.05879,7380,8.872448,53.05882,6120,8.8724,53.05877,4860,8.8724,53.05877,3600,8.87241,53.05878,2340,8.872378,53.0588,1080,8.872383,53.05878]},{"name":"HOGELAND","text":"HOGELAND:Hogeland is an unincorporated community in Blaine County, Montana, United States.

Melanie was the 80th most popular name for girls born in the United States in 2007 and, as Mélanie, it was the 86th most popular name for girls born in France in 2004.[3]","path":[81720,8.8778,53.05439,80340,8.8778,53.05439,78960,8.8778,53.05439,77580,8.8778,53.05439,76260,8.8778,53.05439,74940,8.8778,53.05439,73500,8.8778,53.05439,72120,8.8778,53.05439,71940,8.874028,53.05603,71700,8.867523,53.05804,71580,8.862496,53.05897,70800,8.86184,53.05909,70620,8.860065,53.05937,70260,8.857737,53.0597,70080,8.856827,53.05975,69900,8.851167,53.05933,69780,8.843429,53.05971,69600,8.836886,53.06374,69480,8.830767,53.06768,69240,8.817003,53.06864,69120,8.807502,53.07173,68940,8.801218,53.07594,68820,8.793087,53.07962,68700,8.783928,53.08144,68520,8.77454,53.0836,68400,8.767205,53.08721,67740,8.742708,53.10869,67440,8.726111,53.11656,67260,8.711715,53.11806,67140,8.70082,53.11847,66960,8.689548,53.11982,66780,8.678723,53.12224,66660,8.667762,53.12487,66180,8.635986,53.13381,57240,8.496097,53.4865,56880,8.505306,53.49746,56700,8.51306,53.50473,56400,8.526647,53.51174,56280,8.535011,53.51558,56100,8.545,53.51939,55920,8.55352,53.52254,55740,8.56178,53.52721,55620,8.568698,53.53227,55440,8.575441,53.53547,55320,8.577953,53.53251,54060,8.578009,53.5317,53760,8.577434,53.53005,53640,8.57542,53.52687,53460,8.575142,53.52205,53280,8.578402,53.5162,53160,8.581777,53.51122,52980,8.582167,53.50551,52800,8.58071,53.49974,52320,8.581485,53.49872,51060,8.581485,53.49872,47640,8.581268,53.49895,46320,8.581268,53.49895,45060,8.581268,53.49895,43740,8.581268,53.49895,42420,8.581268,53.49895,41160,8.581268,53.49895,39840,8.581268,53.49895,38580,8.581268,53.49895,37260,8.581268,53.49895,36000,8.581268,53.49895,35880,8.581255,53.49903,35640,8.581306,53.50233,35460,8.582372,53.50793,35340,8.5811,53.51273,35220,8.577372,53.51645,35040,8.57528,53.52121,34920,8.575078,53.52514,34740,8.576675,53.52938,34560,8.577581,53.53203,34080,8.577663,53.53265,33900,8.577282,53.53481,33720,8.573588,53.53425,33600,8.569491,53.52991,33420,8.56413,53.52531,33240,8.556452,53.52139,33120,8.549253,53.51845,32880,8.538669,53.51478,32760,8.531672,53.51184,32520,8.522845,53.50677,32400,8.517117,53.50316,32220,8.511778,53.49893,32100,8.50677,53.49468,31920,8.502588,53.49072,31800,8.498678,53.48578,31560,8.496438,53.4785,31440,8.495388,53.47333,31260,8.49424,53.46861,31080,8.493575,53.46226,30960,8.492851,53.4576,30780,8.491776,53.45285,30660,8.491088,53.44804,30540,8.491181,53.44456,30360,8.491729,53.43959,30240,8.492097,53.43502,30060,8.493056,53.43085,29940,8.494324,53.42569,29760,8.494683,53.42108,29580,8.495007,53.41579,29460,8.495354,53.41119,29280,8.496121,53.40677,29160,8.496825,53.40215,28980,8.497441,53.39697,28680,8.498197,53.38704,28440,8.498986,53.38139,28140,8.500485,53.37156,27600,8.502305,53.35644,27300,8.501862,53.34779,26940,8.496545,53.33721,26580,8.491005,53.32792,26400,8.48926,53.32377,3960,8.751783,53.10791,2580,8.751779,53.10782,1080,8.751779,53.10782]},{"name":"BLUMENTHAL","text":"BLUMENTHAL:is a surname meaning German: \"flower valley\" or \"flowered thaler [coin]\" (from the Florentine coin, the \"florin\") in German.The Blumenthal Award was founded by the American Mathematical Society in 1993 in memory of Leonard M. and Eleanor B.

It is also known as the House of Anhalt, after Anhalt, its longest-held possession. The Ascanians are named after Ascania (or Ascaria) Castle, Schloss Askanien, which is located near and named after Aschersleben. The castle was seat of the County of Ascania, a title that was later subsumed into the titles of the princes of Anhalt. The earliest known member of the house, Esiko, Count of Ballenstedt, first appears in a document of 1036, and is assumed to have been a grandson (through his mother) of Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark. From Odo, the Ascanians inherited large properties in the Saxon Eastern March. Esiko's grandson was Otto, Count of Ballenstedt, who died in 1123. By Otto's marriage to Eilika, daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony, the Ascanians became heirs to half of the property of the House of Billung, former dukes of Saxony. Otto's son, Albert the Bear, became, with the help of his mother's inheritance, the first Ascanian duke of Saxony in 1139. But he lost control of Saxony soon to the rival House of Guelph. However, Albert inherited the Margraviate of Brandenburg from its last Wendish ruler, Pribislav, in 1157, and became the first Ascanian margrave. Albert, and his descendants of the House of Ascania, then made considerable progress in Christianizing and Germanizing the lands. As a borderland between German and Slavic cultures, the country was known as a march. In 1237 and 1244 two towns, Cölln and Berlin were founded during the rule of Otto and Johann, grandsons of Margrave Albert the Bear, (later they were united into one city, Berlin). The emblem of the House of Ascania, red eagle and bear, became the heraldic emblems of Berlin. In 1320 the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end. After the Emperor had deposed the Guelph rulers of Saxony in 1180, Ascanians returned to rule the Duchy of Saxony, which had been reduced to its eastern half by the Emperor. However, even in eastern Saxony, the Ascanians could establish control only in limited areas, mostly near the River Elbe. In the 13th century, the Principality of Anhalt was split off from the Duchy, and later, the remaining state was split into Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. The Ascanian dynasties in the two Saxon states became extinct in 1689 and in 1422, respectively, but Ascanians continued to rule in the smaller state of Anhalt and its various subdivisions until monarchy was abolished in 1918. Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia from 1762–1796, was a member of the House of Ascania, herself the daughter of Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst.","path":[81900,8.872375,53.05082,80520,8.872375,53.05082,79200,8.872375,53.05082,78000,8.872375,53.05082,76680,8.872388,53.05082,75420,8.872388,53.05082,74100,8.872388,53.05082,72720,8.872388,53.05082,71400,8.872388,53.05082,70080,8.872388,53.05082,68820,8.872388,53.05082,67560,8.872434,53.05087,67380,8.874065,53.05342,67200,8.873466,53.05591,67080,8.869558,53.0577,66900,8.864627,53.05864,66000,8.862728,53.05894,65880,8.862456,53.059,65640,8.857752,53.05973,65520,8.852565,53.05969,65280,8.843073,53.05987,65160,8.837432,53.063,64980,8.833464,53.06655,64860,8.827811,53.06776,64740,8.821194,53.06803,64500,8.81192,53.07008,64380,8.805331,53.07279,64140,8.799309,53.07712,64020,8.792793,53.07961,63900,8.78694,53.08111,63660,8.775356,53.08344,63420,8.765054,53.08953,63300,8.760903,53.0942,63120,8.755638,53.09837,63000,8.749277,53.10245,62880,8.744634,53.10651,62640,8.736257,53.11303,62520,8.728797,53.1159,62340,8.719823,53.11757,62160,8.705892,53.11837,61980,8.697244,53.11878,61860,8.687705,53.12042,61680,8.677288,53.12264,61500,8.668465,53.12454,61380,8.659449,53.12592,61200,8.648635,53.12718,61020,8.64205,53.12975,60840,8.634705,53.13493,60660,8.629111,53.14166,60480,8.62712,53.1465,60360,8.626153,53.15182,22020,8.48424,53.33236]},{"name":"LEON","text":"LEON:LEON is a 32-bit CPU microprocessor core, based on the SPARC-V8 RISC architecture and instruction set. It was originally designed by the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), part of the European Space Agency (ESA), and after that by Gaisler Research. It is described in synthesizable VHDL. LEON has a dual license model: An LGPL/GPL FLOSS license that can be used without licensing fee, or a proprietary license that can be purchased for integration in a proprietary product.[1][2] The core is configurable through VHDL generics, and is used in system-on-a-chip (SOC) designs both in research and commercial settings.[3]The LEON project was started by the European Space Agency (ESA) in late 1997 to study and develop a high-performance processor to be used in European space projects.[4] The objectives for the project were to provide an open, portable and non-proprietary processor design, capable to meet future requirements for performance, software compatibility and low system cost. Another objective was to be able to manufacture in a Single event upset (SEU) sensitive semiconductor process. To maintain correct operation in the presence of SEUs, extensive error detection and error handling functions were needed. The goals have been to detect and tolerate one error in any register without software intervention, and to suppress effects from Single Event Transient (SET) errors in combinational logic.The LEON family includes the first LEON1 VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) design that was used in the LEONExpress test chip developed in 0.25 μm technology to prove the fault-tolerance concept. The second LEON2 VHDL design was used in the processor device AT697 from Atmel (F) and various system-on-chip devices. These two LEON implementations were developed by ESA. Gaisler Research, now Aeroflex Gaisler, developed the third LEON3 design and has announced the availability of the fourth generation LEON, the LEON4 processor.[5]A LEON processor can be implemented in programmable logic such as an FPGA or manufactured into an ASIC. This section and the subsequent subsections focus on the LEON processors as soft IP cores and summarise the main features of each processor version and the infrastructure with which the processor is packaged, referred to as a LEON distribution.All processors in the LEON series are based on the SPARC-V8 RISC architecture. LEON2(-FT) has a five-stage pipeline while later versions have a seven-stage pipeline. LEON2 and LEON2-FT are distributed as a system-on-chip design that can be modified using a graphical configuration tool. While the LEON2(-FT) design can be extended and re-used in other designs, its structure does not emphasise re-using parts of the design as building blocks or enable designers to easily incorporate new IP cores in the design.The standard LEON2(-FT) distribution includes the following support cores:[6]The LEON3, LEON3FT and LEON4 cores are typically used together with the GRLIB IP Library. While the LEON2 distributions contain one design that can be used on several target technologies, GRLIB contains several template designs, both for FPGA development boards and for ASIC targets that can be modified using a graphical configuration tool similar to the one in the LEON2 distribution. The LEON/GRLIB package contains a larger number of cores compared to the LEON2 distributions and also include a plug and play extension to the on-chip AMBA bus. IP cores available in GRLIB include:[7]Design Flow Documentation for the LEON into FPGA are available from the manufacturer[8] and from third party resources.[9]The term LEON2/LEON2-FT often refer to the LEON2 system-on-chip design, which is the LEON2 processor core together with the standard set of peripherals available in the LEON2(-FT) distribution. Later processors in the LEON series are used in a wide range of designs and are therefore not as tightly coupled with a standard set of peripherals. With LEON3 and LEON4 the name typically refers to only the processor core, while LEON/GRLIB is used to refer to the complete system-on-chip design.LEON2 has the following characteristics:The LEON2-FT processor is the single event upset fault tolerant (FT) version of the LEON2 processor. Flip-flops are protected by triple modular redundancy and all internal and external memories are protected by EDAC or parity bits. Special licence restrictions apply to this IP (distributed by the European Space Agency[12]). Among other satellites, the processor was used in ESA's Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) in 2015.[13]The LEON3 is a synthesisable VHDL model of a 32-bit processor compliant with the SPARC V8 architecture. The model is highly configurable, and particularly suitable for system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. The full source code is available under the GNU GPL license, allowing use for any purpose without licensing fee. LEON3 is also available under a proprietary license, allowing it to be used in proprietary applications.There are several differences between the two LEON2 processor models and the LEON3. LEON3 includes SMP support and a seven-stage pipeline, while LEON2 does not support SMP and has a five-stage pipeline.The LEON3FT is a fault-tolerant version of the standard LEON3 SPARC V8 Processor.

That’s because it’s located nearly at the north celestial pole, the point around which the entire northern sky turns. Polaris marks the way due north. As you face Polaris and stretch your arms sideways, your right hand points due east, and your left hand points due west. About-face of Polaris steers you due south. Polaris is not the brightest star in the nighttime sky, as is commonly believed. It’s only about 50th brightest. But you can find it easily, and, once you do, you’ll see it shining in the northern sky every night, from N. Hemisphere locations. Follow the links below to learn more about Polaris.How to see Polaris. This star is bright enough to spot even from some suburban skies. In a dark country sky, even when the full moon obscures a good deal of the starry heavens, the North Star is relatively easy to see.\n\nThat fact has made this star a boon to travelers throughout the Northern Hemisphere, both over land and sea. Finding Polaris means you know the direction north.\n\nBest of all, Polaris is readily found by using the prominent group of stars known as the Big Dipper, called the Plough in the UK, which may be the Northern Hemisphere’s most famous star pattern.To locate Polaris, all you have to do is to find the Big Dipper pointer stars Dubhe and Merak. These two stars outline the outer part of the Big Dipper’s bowl. Simply draw a line from Merak through Dubhe, and go about 5 times the Merak/Dubhe distance to Polaris. The Big Dipper, like a great big hour hand, goes full circle around Polaris in one day. More specifically, the Big Dipper circles Polaris in a counter-clockwise direction in 23 hours and 56 minutes. Although the Big Dipper travels around Polaris all night long, the Big Dipper pointer stars always point to Polaris on any day of the year, and at any time of the night. Polaris marks the center of Nature’s grandest celestial clock! By the way, Polaris is famous for more reasons than one. It’s famous for hardly moving while the other stars wheel around it. And it’s famous for marking the end of the Little Dipper‘s handle. The Little Dipper is tougher to spot in the night sky than the Big Dipper. But if you use the Big Dipper’s pointer stars to locate Polaris, you’ll be one step closer to seeing the Little Dipper. As you travel northward, Polaris climbs higher in the sky. If you go as far north as the North Pole, you’ll see Polaris directly overhead. As you travel south, Polaris drops closer to the northern horizon. If you get as far as the equator, Polaris sinks to the horizon. South of the equator, Polaris drops out of the sky.Polaris science. The single point of light that we see as Polaris is actually a triple star system, or three stars orbiting a common center of mass. The primary star, Polaris A, is a supergiant with about six times the mass of our sun. A close companion, Polaris Ab, orbits 2 billion miles from Polaris. Much farther away, near the top of the illustration at right, is the third companion Polaris B. Polaris B is located approximately 240 billion miles from Polaris A. The two companion stars are the same temperature as Polaris A, but are dwarf stars. Astronomers estimate Polaris’ distance at 430 light-years. Considering the distance, Polaris must be a respectably luminous star. According to the star aficianado, Jim Kaler, Polaris is a yellow supergiant star shining with the luminosity of 2500 suns. Polaris is also the closest and brightest Cepheid variable star – a type of star that astronomers use to figure distances to star clusters and galaxies.","path":[63480,9.109405,52.98709,63120,9.097145,52.99056,62940,9.092477,52.99188,62820,9.086768,52.99351,62640,9.0818,52.99492,62460,9.074986,52.99606,61980,9.051842,52.99463,61680,9.039667,52.99426,61560,9.034475,52.99235,61380,9.029012,52.98933,61200,9.021307,52.98846,61080,9.014922,52.98926,60900,9.007961,52.99128,60720,9.003351,52.9942,60600,8.997559,52.99501,60480,8.993435,52.99211,60300,8.987663,52.99199,59940,8.990965,53.0021,59760,8.992073,53.00589,59520,8.98241,53.009,59400,8.974856,53.00761,59160,8.965424,53.00469,58980,8.95796,53.00043,58740,8.948955,52.99705,58620,8.943385,52.99945,58380,8.941355,53.00589,58200,8.936893,53.00898,58080,8.928391,53.00919,57960,8.92037,53.01013,57780,8.911397,53.01151,57600,8.902389,53.01247,57480,8.894657,53.01325,57300,8.889129,53.01768,57180,8.885358,53.02235,56940,8.875308,53.02815,56760,8.869003,53.03121,56640,8.865757,53.03551,56400,8.867815,53.04277,56280,8.87076,53.04705,56160,8.873355,53.05125,55980,8.873995,53.05521,55860,8.870625,53.05725,54780,8.868769,53.05769,53520,8.868769,53.05769,52200,8.868769,53.05769,50820,8.868769,53.05769,49560,8.868769,53.05769,48240,8.868769,53.05769,48060,8.866986,53.05814,47880,8.862908,53.05889,47040,8.862145,53.05902,46920,8.861818,53.05905,46740,8.859576,53.05937,46500,8.858022,53.05957,45120,8.858022,53.05957,44940,8.857942,53.05958,44760,8.853127,53.05951,44580,8.848182,53.05913,44460,8.840484,53.06081,44280,8.835413,53.06524,44160,8.82922,53.06777,43980,8.82134,53.06804,43860,8.812681,53.06979,43680,8.805602,53.07253,43320,8.791039,53.08022,43020,8.774897,53.08381,42420,8.753533,53.09994,32700,8.495633,53.34133,32400,8.49937,53.35447,32220,8.499257,53.36156,31980,8.498069,53.37029,31860,8.497258,53.37582,31740,8.496962,53.3806,31560,8.496305,53.38665,31380,8.495276,53.39359,31260,8.494298,53.40007,31080,8.493465,53.40653,30960,8.492635,53.41265,30780,8.49184,53.41969,30600,8.490835,53.42762,30420,8.490053,53.43298,30300,8.489188,53.43945,30180,8.488918,53.44432,30060,8.488873,53.44915,29880,8.489569,53.45566,29760,8.490276,53.46132,29580,8.491305,53.46883,29400,8.491742,53.4749,29280,8.4931,53.48075,29100,8.495481,53.48617,28980,8.496239,53.48921,28620,8.493914,53.48756,27300,8.493914,53.48756,26040,8.493914,53.48756,24720,8.493914,53.48756,23340,8.493914,53.48756,22020,8.493914,53.48756,20760,8.493914,53.48756,19440,8.493914,53.48756,18180,8.493914,53.48756,16860,8.493914,53.48756,15540,8.493914,53.48756,14280,8.493914,53.48756,12960,8.493914,53.48756,11640,8.493914,53.48756,10320,8.493914,53.48756,9000,8.493914,53.48756,7680,8.493914,53.48756,6360,8.493914,53.48756,4980,8.493914,53.48756,3660,8.493914,53.48756,2340,8.493914,53.48756,1020,8.493914,53.48756]},{"name":"MARU","text":"MARU:Maru is a Maori war god, especially well known in southern New Zealand, where he replaces Tūmatauenga, the war god of the rest of New Zealand.

It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO[7] (\"laugh(ing) my ass off\") and ROFL[8][9][10] (or its older form ROTFL;[11][12] \"roll(ing) on the floor laughing\"). Other unrelated expansions include the now mostly obsolete \"lots of luck\" or \"lots of love\" used in letter-writing.[13]The list of acronyms \"grows by the month\"[9] and they are collected along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, IRC, and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication.[14] These initialisms are controversial, and several authors[15][16][17][18] recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications.LOL was first documented in the Oxford English Dictionary in March 2011.[19]Laccetti (professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology) and Molski, in their essay entitled The Lost Art of Writing, are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, \"Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not be 'lol' when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made-up words, and silly acronyms.\"[15][16] Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that \"professional or business communication should never be careless or poorly constructed\" whether one is writing an electronic mail message or an article for publication, and warn against the use of smileys and these abbreviations, stating that they are \"no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication\".[17]Yunker and Barry in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through podcasting have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are \"often misunderstood\" by students and are \"difficult to decipher\" unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of \"ROFL\" as not obviously being the abbreviation of \"rolling on the floor laughing\" (emphasis added).[18] Haig singles out LOL as one of the three most popular initialisms in Internet slang, alongside BFN[dubious – discuss] (\"bye for now\") and IMHO (\"in my honest/humble opinion\"). He describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that \"as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing\".[1] Bidgoli likewise states that these initialisms \"save keystrokes for the sender but [...] might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver\" and that \"[s]lang may hold different meanings and lead to misunderstandings especially in international settings\"; he advises that they be used \"only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning\".[20]Shortis observes that ROFL is a means of \"annotating text with stage directions\".[10] Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: \"The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor.\"[9]David Crystal notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question \"How many people are actually 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?\".[21] Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL.[2]Victoria Clarke, in her analysis of telnet talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that \"a user who types LOL may well be laughing louder than one who types lol\", and opines that \"these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse\".[22] Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful as long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are (in his view) appropriate in such correspondence.[3] June Hines Moore shares that view.[23] So, too, does Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, \"or you won't be LOL\".[24]LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystal—likening the introduction of LOL, ROFL, and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the 15th century—states that this is \"a brand new variety of language evolving\", invented by young people within five years, that \"extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language\".[25][26]Geoffrey K. Pullum points out that even if interjections such as LOL and ROFL were to become very common in spoken English, their \"total effect on language\" would be \"utterly trivial\".[27]Conversely, a 2003 study of college students by Naomi Baron found that the use of these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually lower than she had expected. The students \"used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons\". The spelling was \"reasonably good\" and contractions were \"not ubiquitous\". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total, only 31 CMC-style abbreviations, and 49 emoticons.[26] Out of the 90 initialisms, 76 were occurrences of LOL.[28]While LOL and similar acronyms are used a lot in real life speech, a lot of people are annoyed with this, say it accidentally or use it ironically.[29]On March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other acronyms, was formally recognized in an update of the Oxford English Dictionary.[19][30] In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for \"little old lady\" in the 1960s.[31] They also discovered that the oldest written record of the use of LOL in the contemporary meaning of \"Laughing Out Loud\" was from a message typed by Wayne Pearson in the 1980s, from the archives of Usenet.[32]Gabriella Coleman references \"lulz\" extensively in her anthropological studies of Anonymous.[33][34]The past tense of lol is lolled. The participle form is lolling.Most of these variants are usually found in lowercase.In some languages with a non-Latin script, the abbreviation LOL itself is also often transliterated. See for example Arabic لول and Russian лол.[citation needed]Pre-dating the Internet and phone texting by a century, the way to express laughter in morse code is \"hi hi\". The sound of this in morse ('di-di-di-dit di-dit, di-di-di-dit di-dit') is thought to represent chuckling.[49][50]","path":[48720,8.991952,53.00527,48120,8.958633,53.00089,47760,8.94181,53.0019,47640,8.93954,53.00838,47460,8.930634,53.00913,47220,8.912742,53.01136,47100,8.90217,53.01249,46920,8.89091,53.01529,46740,8.886523,53.02103,46500,8.873201,53.02918,46320,8.866359,53.03347,46200,8.866043,53.03917,46020,8.86931,53.04497,45900,8.873123,53.05033,45720,8.873823,53.05489,45600,8.870842,53.05722,44280,8.870307,53.05732,42900,8.870307,53.05732,41580,8.870307,53.05732,40260,8.870307,53.05732,40140,8.86826,53.05775,39900,8.862967,53.0589,39060,8.86185,53.05907,38820,8.858377,53.05964,38700,8.853728,53.05947,38520,8.85255,53.05936,38040,8.85081,53.05926,37740,8.846869,53.05908,37620,8.843955,53.05944,36900,8.83419,53.06602,36720,8.829785,53.06764,36600,8.821961,53.06793,36360,8.811836,53.07003,36120,8.803298,53.0741,35580,8.778227,53.08244]},{"name":"LAURA","text":"LAURA:is a female given name in Latin, Western Europe and North America whose meaning (\"Bay Laurel\") translates to victor, and an early hypocorism from Laurel and Lauren.The name Laura is the feminized form of laurus, Latin for \"bay laurel plant\", which in the Greco-Roman era was used as a symbol of victory, honor or fame.

Münden, where the rivers Werra and Fulda join to form the Weser and follows the course of the Upper Weser northwards through the Weser Uplands to Bodenwerder, then continues in a northwestern direction, south of the Süntel hills and the Weser Hills, and ends finally at the great gap of Porta Westfalica, where the Weser breaks through the Wiehen and Weser Hills out into the North German Plain.

As a commercial and industrial city with a major port on the River Weser, Bremen is part of the Bremen/Oldenburg Metropolitan Region, with 2.4 million people. Bremen is the second most populous city in Northern Germany and eleventh in Germany.[3]Bremen is a major cultural and economic hub in the northern regions of Germany. Bremen is home to dozens of historical galleries and museums, ranging from historical sculptures to major art museums, such as the Übersee-Museum Bremen.[4] Bremen has a reputation as a working class city.[5] Along with this, Bremen is home to a large number of multinational companies and manufacturing centers. Companies headquartered in Bremen include the Hachez chocolate company and Vector Foiltec.[6] Four-time German football champions Werder Bremen are also based in the city.\nBremen is some 60 km (37 mi) south from the Weser mouth on the North Sea. With Bremerhaven right on the mouth the two comprise the state of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen (official German name: Freie Hansestadt Bremen).The marshes and moraines near Bremen have been settled since about 12,000 BC. Burial places and settlements in Bremen-Mahndorf and Bremen-Osterholz date back to the 7th century AD. Since The Renaissance, some scientists have believed that the entry Fabiranum or Phabiranon in Ptolemy's Fourth Map of Europe,[7] written in 150 AD, refers to Bremen. But Ptolemy gives geographic coordinates, and by these dates Phabiranon is situated northeast of the mouth of river Visurgis (Weser). At that time the Chauci lived in the area now called north-western Germany or Lower Saxony. By the end of the 3rd century, they had merged with the Saxons. During the Saxon Wars (772–804) the Saxons, led by Widukind, fought against the West Germanic Franks, the founders of the Carolingian Empire, and lost the war. Charlemagne, the King of the Franks, made a new law, the Lex Saxonum. This law stated that Saxons were not allowed to worship Odin (the god of the Saxons), but rather that they had to convert to Christianity on pain of death. This period was called the Christianisation. In 787 Willehad of Bremen was the first Bishop of Bremen. In 848 the archdiocese of Hamburg merged with the diocese of Bremen into Hamburg-Bremen Archdiocese, seated in Bremen, and in the following centuries the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen were the driving force behind the Christianisation of Northern Germany. In 888 Archbishop Rimbert, managed to get Kaiser Arnulf of Carinthia, the Carolingian King of East Francia, to grant Bremen the right to hold its own markets, to mint its own coins and make its own customs laws. The city's first stone walls were built in 1032. Around this time trade with Norway, England and the northern Netherlands began to grow, thus increasing the importance of the city.In 1186 the Bremian Prince-Archbishop Hartwig of Uthlede and his bailiff in Bremen confirmed—without generally waiving the prince-archiepiscopal overlordship over the city—the Gelnhausen Privilege, by which Frederick I Barbarossa granted the city considerable privileges. The city was recognised as a political entity with its own laws. Property within the municipal boundaries could not be subjected to feudal overlordship; this also applied to serfs who acquired property, if they managed to live in the city for a year and a day, after which they were to be regarded as free persons. Property was to be freely inherited without feudal claims for reversion to its original owner. This privilege laid the foundation for Bremen's later status of imperial immediacy (Free Imperial City).In fact, however, Bremen did not have complete independence from the Prince-Archbishops, in that there was no freedom of religion, and burghers were still forced to pay taxes to the Prince-Archbishops. Bremen played a double role; it participated in the Diets of the neighbouring Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen as part of the Bremian Estates and paid its share of taxes, at least when it had previously consented to this levy. Since the city was the major taxpayer, its consent was generally sought. In this way the city wielded fiscal and political power within the Prince-Archbishopric, while not allowing the Prince-Archbishopric to rule in the city against its consent. In 1260 Bremen joined the Hanseatic League.\n\n","path":[81000,8.750907,53.10443,79740,8.750852,53.10444,78480,8.750903,53.10444,77220,8.750907,53.10443,75960,8.75089,53.10443,74520,8.750892,53.10442,73260,8.750941,53.10448,71820,8.750888,53.10445,70560,8.750876,53.10443,69300,8.750875,53.10444,68040,8.750903,53.10443,66780,8.750881,53.10443,65520,8.750898,53.10444,64260,8.75091,53.10443,63000,8.750869,53.10443,61740,8.750914,53.10442,60480,8.750903,53.10445,51840,8.750887,53.10441,48360,8.780037,53.08211,48000,8.795525,53.07889,47160,8.830292,53.06783,46980,8.837764,53.06296,46860,8.843037,53.06003,46740,8.850291,53.05937,46500,8.859098,53.05952,46320,8.861975,53.05905,45780,8.862757,53.05891,45540,8.86355,53.05881,45420,8.864652,53.05861,45300,8.866565,53.05827,45120,8.870265,53.05747,45000,8.874142,53.05607,44880,8.874545,53.05253,44760,8.873138,53.04958,44580,8.870954,53.04631,44400,8.866491,53.04005,44280,8.86568,53.03563,44160,8.869402,53.03115,43980,8.876133,53.02761,43800,8.88346,53.0237,43620,8.880695,53.02542,43500,8.877209,53.02717,43320,8.876535,53.02585,43200,8.874045,53.02533,43020,8.875069,53.02577,42480,8.875225,53.0259,41160,8.875235,53.02592,39840,8.875243,53.02592,39540,8.874725,53.02561,39420,8.87325,53.02536,39180,8.873359,53.02578,39060,8.876703,53.02637,38760,8.870058,53.03045,38640,8.866018,53.03404,38520,8.8657,53.03831,38340,8.86737,53.04244,38160,8.871411,53.04807,37980,8.876678,53.04919,37860,8.879592,53.04656,37620,8.876607,53.04922,37380,8.874257,53.05224,37140,8.879639,53.05217,37020,8.88117,53.05043,36840,8.879875,53.05187,36600,8.87693,53.05471,36420,8.874822,53.05753,36300,8.878217,53.05803,36060,8.874352,53.05754,35880,8.869246,53.05775,35760,8.865717,53.05843,35460,8.863255,53.05883,34800,8.862917,53.05887,34680,8.86277,53.05893,34560,8.861511,53.05913,34440,8.859921,53.05941,34200,8.856571,53.05978,34080,8.854835,53.05988,33960,8.852199,53.05951,33840,8.847765,53.05904,33660,8.842863,53.05988,33480,8.836846,53.06339,33360,8.833467,53.06637,33240,8.828565,53.06761,33060,8.823033,53.06775,32880,8.815077,53.06914,32760,8.809756,53.07086,31860,8.777527,53.08264,31740,8.770892,53.08495,28740,8.77581,53.08827,4500,8.750856,53.10445,3240,8.75088,53.10445,1980,8.750883,53.10445,720,8.750892,53.10443]},{"name":"HILDEGARD","text":"HILDEGARD:The female name Hildegard derived from the Old High German words hild (=war or battle) and gard (=protection) and means \"protecting battle-maid\".[1][2] Variant spellings include Hildegarde.

It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO[7] (\"laugh(ing) my ass off\") and ROFL[8][9][10] (or its older form ROTFL;[11][12] \"roll(ing) on the floor laughing\"). Other unrelated expansions include the now mostly obsolete \"lots of luck\" or \"lots of love\" used in letter-writing.[13]The list of acronyms \"grows by the month\"[9] and they are collected along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, IRC, and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication.[14] These initialisms are controversial, and several authors[15][16][17][18] recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications.LOL was first documented in the Oxford English Dictionary in March 2011.[19]Laccetti (professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology) and Molski, in their essay entitled The Lost Art of Writing, are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, \"Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not be 'lol' when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made-up words, and silly acronyms.\"[15][16] Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that \"professional or business communication should never be careless or poorly constructed\" whether one is writing an electronic mail message or an article for publication, and warn against the use of smileys and these abbreviations, stating that they are \"no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication\".[17]Yunker and Barry in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through podcasting have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are \"often misunderstood\" by students and are \"difficult to decipher\" unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of \"ROFL\" as not obviously being the abbreviation of \"rolling on the floor laughing\" (emphasis added).[18] Haig singles out LOL as one of the three most popular initialisms in Internet slang, alongside BFN[dubious – discuss] (\"bye for now\") and IMHO (\"in my honest/humble opinion\"). He describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that \"as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing\".[1] Bidgoli likewise states that these initialisms \"save keystrokes for the sender but [...] might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver\" and that \"[s]lang may hold different meanings and lead to misunderstandings especially in international settings\"; he advises that they be used \"only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning\".[20]Shortis observes that ROFL is a means of \"annotating text with stage directions\".[10] Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: \"The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor.\"[9]David Crystal notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question \"How many people are actually 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?\".[21] Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL.[2]Victoria Clarke, in her analysis of telnet talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that \"a user who types LOL may well be laughing louder than one who types lol\", and opines that \"these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse\".[22] Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful as long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are (in his view) appropriate in such correspondence.[3] June Hines Moore shares that view.[23] So, too, does Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, \"or you won't be LOL\".[24]LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystal—likening the introduction of LOL, ROFL, and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the 15th century—states that this is \"a brand new variety of language evolving\", invented by young people within five years, that \"extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language\".[25][26]Geoffrey K. Pullum points out that even if interjections such as LOL and ROFL were to become very common in spoken English, their \"total effect on language\" would be \"utterly trivial\".[27]Conversely, a 2003 study of college students by Naomi Baron found that the use of these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually lower than she had expected. The students \"used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons\". The spelling was \"reasonably good\" and contractions were \"not ubiquitous\". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total, only 31 CMC-style abbreviations, and 49 emoticons.[26] Out of the 90 initialisms, 76 were occurrences of LOL.[28]While LOL and similar acronyms are used a lot in real life speech, a lot of people are annoyed with this, say it accidentally or use it ironically.[29]On March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other acronyms, was formally recognized in an update of the Oxford English Dictionary.[19][30] In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for \"little old lady\" in the 1960s.[31] They also discovered that the oldest written record of the use of LOL in the contemporary meaning of \"Laughing Out Loud\" was from a message typed by Wayne Pearson in the 1980s, from the archives of Usenet.[32]Gabriella Coleman references \"lulz\" extensively in her anthropological studies of Anonymous.[33][34]The past tense of lol is lolled. The participle form is lolling.Most of these variants are usually found in lowercase.In some languages with a non-Latin script, the abbreviation LOL itself is also often transliterated. See for example Arabic لول and Russian лол.[citation needed]Pre-dating the Internet and phone texting by a century, the way to express laughter in morse code is \"hi hi\". The sound of this in morse ('di-di-di-dit di-dit, di-di-di-dit di-dit') is thought to represent chuckling.[49][50]","path":[82260,8.747905,53.11907,80940,8.747905,53.11907,79620,8.747905,53.11907,78240,8.747905,53.11907,76740,8.747905,53.11907,75480,8.747905,53.11907,74160,8.747905,53.11907,72900,8.747905,53.11907,71580,8.747905,53.11907,70200,8.747905,53.11907,68880,8.747905,53.11907,67440,8.747905,53.11907,66120,8.747905,53.11907,64620,8.747905,53.11907,63180,8.747905,53.11907,61800,8.747905,53.11907,60420,8.747905,53.11907,44040,8.79372,53.07951,43620,8.812277,53.06999,43500,8.819953,53.06818,43320,8.828613,53.06795,43200,8.83543,53.06525,43020,8.841585,53.06056,42840,8.84997,53.05929,42660,8.857413,53.05971,42540,8.862055,53.05908,41760,8.86304,53.0589,41640,8.863847,53.05875,41460,8.867784,53.05801,41340,8.872118,53.05674,41220,8.873932,53.05428,41040,8.87295,53.05068,40920,8.870506,53.04655,40740,8.867195,53.04188,40620,8.865748,53.03696,40440,8.867365,53.03257,40320,8.87363,53.02907,40140,8.880261,53.02585,39960,8.886512,53.02145,39720,8.892002,53.01443,39600,8.900885,53.01272,39360,8.911658,53.01172,39180,8.921142,53.01031,38940,8.936585,53.00926,38640,8.942413,53.00043]},{"name":"BUGSI","text":"BUGSI:Bugsy is a 1991 American crime-drama film directed by Barry Levinson which tells the story of mobster Bugsy Siegel and his relationship with Virginia Hill. It stars Warren Beatty as Siegel and Annette Bening as Hill, as well as Harvey Keitel, Ben Kingsley, Elliott Gould, and Joe Mantegna. The screenplay was written by James Toback from research material by Dean Jennings' 1967 book We Only Kill Each Other.The film received acclaim from critics, including Roger Ebert, and was nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning two for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design. As of 2016, the film is the most recent to receive more than one nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category.\nA director's cut was released on DVD, containing an additional 13 minutes not seen in the theatrical version.Gangster Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel, who works for the New York mob, goes to California and instantly falls in love with Virginia Hill, a tough-talking Hollywood starlet. The two meet for the first time when Bugsy visits his friend, actor George Raft, on a film set. He buys a house in Beverly Hills from opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, planning to stay there while his wife and two daughters remain in Scarsdale.As a representative for his associates Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, Bugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from Los Angeles gangster Jack Dragna. Mickey Cohen robs Dragna's operation one day. He is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed. Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Dragna is forced to admit to a raging Bugsy that he stole $14,000, and is told he now answers to Cohen.After arguments about Virginia's trysts with drummer Gene Krupa and a variety of bullfighters and Siegel's reluctance to get a divorce, Virginia makes a romantic move on Bugsy. On a trip to Nevada to visit a gambling joint, Bugsy comes up with the idea for a hotel and casino in the desert. He obtains $1 million in funding from lifelong friend Lansky and other New York mobsters, reminding them that in Nevada, gambling is legal.Virginia wants no part of it until Bugsy puts her in charge of accounting and begins construction of the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, but the budget soon soars to $6 million due to his extravagance. Bugsy tries everything to ensure it gets completed, even selling his share of the casino.Bugsy is visited in Los Angeles by former associate Harry Greenberg. Harry has betrayed his old associates to save himself. He has also run out of money, from a combination of his gambling habits and being extorted by prosecutors who want his testimony. Though he is Harry's trusted friend, Bugsy has no choice but to kill him. He is arrested for the murder, but the only witness is a cab driver who dropped Harry off in front of Bugsy's house. The driver is paid to leave town.Lansky is waiting for Bugsy outside the jail. He gives a satchel of money to his friend. \"Charlie doesn't have to know about it,\" he tells Bugsy, but warns, \"I can't protect you anymore.\" The Flamingo's opening night is a total failure, and $2 million of the budget is unaccounted for, whereupon Bugsy discovers that Virginia stole the money. He tells her to \"keep it and save it for a rainy day.\" He then tells Lansky never to sell his share of the casino because he will live to thank him someday.Later that night, Bugsy is shot and killed in his home. Virginia is told the news in Las Vegas and knows her own days could be numbered. An epilogue states that Virginia returned the missing money a week later and committed suicide at some point after that. It also states that by 1991, the $6 million invested in Bugsy's dream of Las Vegas had generated revenues of over $100 billion.","path":[81360,8.565757,53.54755,80040,8.56569,53.5476,78780,8.565713,53.54758,77520,8.565692,53.54762,76140,8.565726,53.54759,74700,8.565701,53.5476,73380,8.565733,53.54764,72060,8.56574,53.54759,70680,8.565719,53.54762,69420,8.565723,53.5476,68160,8.565728,53.54757,66780,8.565692,53.54759,65400,8.565733,53.54758,64080,8.565746,53.54759,62760,8.565745,53.54759,61440,8.565726,53.54758,60120,8.56573,53.54757,58740,8.565732,53.54757,57480,8.565715,53.54755,56100,8.56573,53.54759,54780,8.565703,53.54759,53340,8.565666,53.54758,52080,8.5657,53.54755,50820,8.565706,53.54759,49380,8.565703,53.54758,49140,8.56733,53.54247,49020,8.569654,53.53585,48780,8.564623,53.52607,48660,8.555135,53.52149,48480,8.545243,53.51766,48360,8.534057,53.51305,48180,8.52477,53.50881,48060,8.516125,53.50417,47880,8.508995,53.49757,47760,8.502883,53.49152,47640,8.498018,53.48574,47460,8.495778,53.47891,47340,8.494145,53.47109,47160,8.493093,53.46434,47040,8.49179,53.45722,46920,8.49096,53.45042,46680,8.491306,53.44019,46500,8.492414,53.43201,46380,8.493675,53.42462,46200,8.494945,53.41714,46080,8.495829,53.40937,45840,8.496755,53.39923,45720,8.497757,53.39213,45540,8.498478,53.38549,45420,8.499124,53.37787,45240,8.499895,53.37072,45120,8.500903,53.36404,4920,8.718353,53.12665,3600,8.71838,53.12664,2220,8.718403,53.12666,900,8.718322,53.12651]},{"name":"BUGSIER 1","text":"BUGSIER 1:Vessel BUGSIER 11 (IMO: 9800348, MMSI: 218817000) is an unknown type and currently sailing under the flag of Germany.

It is bounded by (clockwise from the north) the districts of Nienburg, Hanover and Hamelin-Pyrmont, and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (districts of Lippe and Minden-Lübbecke).Landkreis Schaumburg was created on August 1, 1977 within the framework of the Kreisreform (district reform) of Lower Saxony by combining the former districts of Schaumburg-Lippe and Grafschaft Schaumburg. The town of Hessisch Oldendorf was reallocated to Landkreis Hameln-Pyrmont. The communities of Großenheidorn, Idensermoor-Niengraben and Steinhude had already been allocated to the community of Wunsdorf and thereby became part of Landkreis Hanover.The Landkreis Schaumburg essentially duplicates the borders of Schaumburg at the time of the Middle Ages. Schaumburg was a medieval county, which was founded at the beginning of the 12th century. Shortly after, the Holy Roman Emperor appointed the counts of Schaumburg to become counts of Holstein as well.During the Thirty Years' War the House of Schaumburg had no male heir, and the county was divided into Schaumburg (which became part of Hesse-Kassel) and the County of Schaumburg-Lippe (1640). As a member of the Confederation of the Rhine, Schaumburg-Lippe raised itself to a principality. In 1815, Schaumburg-Lippe joined the German Confederation, and in 1871 the German Empire. In 1918, it became a republic. The tiny Free State of Schaumburg-Lippe existed until 1946, when it became an administrative area within Lower Saxony. Schaumburg-Lippe had an area of 340 km², and a population of 51,000 (as of 1934).Hessian Schaumburg was annexed to Prussia along with the rest of Hesse-Kassel in 1866. After World War II, Schaumburg and Schaumburg-Lippe became districts within the state of Lower Saxony, until they were merged again in 1977.The district (Landkreis) of Schaumburg has its northern half located in the North German Plain and the southern half in the Weser Uplands (Weserbergland). The Weser Uplands consist of hilly ridges and include the Wesergebirge, Harrl, Süntel, Bückeberg and Deister. The Schaumburg Forest is a continuous strip of woods running in a direction of approximately 60 degrees along the northern border of the district. Just beyond the northern border of the district is Lake Steinhude actually a 29,1 km2 shallow lake that is the largest in Northern Germany. The river Weser flows westward along the south of the Wiehengebirge through a broad valley and the town of Rinteln. The landscape is bordered to the west by the River Weser which is actually in the neighbouring district of Minden-Lübbecke. It flows north through the Westphalian Gap towards the city of Bremen and the North Sea. In the flat North German Plain to the east of Schaumburg district lies Hanover, the capital city of Lower Saxony.The coat of arms is almost identical to the old arms of Schaumburg, which had been used since the 12th century. Schaumburg Castle, in mediaeval times the seat of the Counts of Schaumburg, is located on the Nesselberg (\"nettle mountain\") in Schaumburg, a locality in the town of Rinteln. The nettle leaf in the middle of the arms has become the heraldic symbol of Holstein, symbolising the historical connection between Holstein and Schaumburg.Inhabitants as of[update] December 31, 2005:TownsSamtgemeinden (collective municipalities) with their member municipalities * seat of the collective municipalityMedia related to Landkreis Schaumburg at Wikimedia CommonsCircles est. 1500: Bavarian, Swabian, Upper Rhenish, Lower Rhenish–Westphalian, Franconian, (Lower) SaxonCoordinates: 52°15′N 9°10′E﻿ / ﻿52.25°N 9.17°E﻿ / 52.25; 9.17","path":[82320,9.111132,52.57086,79500,9.111132,52.57086,77520,9.111132,52.57086,76260,9.111132,52.57086,74580,9.111132,52.57086,73080,9.111132,52.57086,71460,9.111132,52.57086,70200,9.111132,52.57086,68880,9.111132,52.57086,67380,9.111132,52.57086,41220,8.99166,53.00615,41100,8.9864,53.00911,40980,8.980759,53.00869,40860,8.974968,53.00757,40680,8.965263,53.0046,40500,8.95801,53.00044,40260,8.947284,52.99753,40080,8.942355,53.00118,39960,8.941267,53.00616,39780,8.936035,53.00902,39600,8.925917,53.00956,39480,8.91704,53.01071,39240,8.905949,53.01217,39120,8.8976,53.01291,39000,8.891434,53.0149,38820,8.887385,53.02014,38640,8.882187,53.02463,38400,8.872046,53.02985,38280,8.86638,53.03399,38040,8.867165,53.04128,37920,8.870385,53.0462,37680,8.874315,53.05282,37560,8.873377,53.05701,37380,8.875823,53.05753,35880,8.876786,53.05764,34500,8.876786,53.05764,33240,8.876786,53.05764,31920,8.876786,53.05764,30600,8.876786,53.05764,30480,8.877229,53.0575,29280,8.877805,53.05775,27960,8.877805,53.05775,26580,8.877805,53.05775,25200,8.877805,53.05775,23880,8.877805,53.05775,22560,8.877805,53.05775,21180,8.877805,53.05775,19860,8.877805,53.05775,18600,8.877805,53.05775,17220,8.877805,53.05775,15840,8.877805,53.05775,14520,8.877805,53.05775,13200,8.877805,53.05775,11820,8.877805,53.05775,10440,8.877805,53.05775,9120,8.877805,53.05775,7800,8.877805,53.05775,6480,8.877805,53.05775,5220,8.877805,53.05775,3840,8.877805,53.05775,2520,8.877805,53.05775,1200,8.877805,53.05775]},{"name":"BRITTA","text":"BRITTA:Britta (also spelled Brita) is a female given name that is a variant of the Swedish name Birgitta, which is a form of the Irish Gaelic name Brighid (Bridget in English).

They are medium to large species found in Mexico, and Central and northern South America. The Mexican violetear occasionally wanders as far north as the United States and even Canada.Violetears have ample rounded tails and short or medium black bills. Three of the four species have a mainly green plumage. The males have a violet blue patch running back and down from the eye, which is erected when they are excited, and a glittering throat patch. The female plumage is generally like the male’s, but the ear and throat patches are smaller.Violetears build substantial cup nests into which two white eggs are laid. They have loud persistent songs, often repetitions of double notes.These birds come readily to artificial nectar feeders, and show no fear of humans. They are aggressively territorial, and at feeders or flowering shrubs they spend much time chasing other hummingbirds, rather than feeding.COLIBRI, a Lisp machine co-processor.\nLisp machines are general-purpose computers designed to efficiently run Lisp as their main software language, usually through hardware support. They are an example of a high-level language computer architecture, and in a sense, they were the first commercial single-user workstations. Despite being modest in number (perhaps 7,000 units total as of 1988[1]), Lisp machines commercially pioneered many now-commonplace technologies – including effective garbage collection, laser printing, windowing systems, computer mice, high-resolution bit-mapped graphics, computer graphic rendering, and networking innovations like Chaosnet.[citation needed] Several companies built and sold Lisp Machines in the 1980s: Symbolics (3600, 3640, XL1200, MacIvory, and other models), Lisp Machines Incorporated (LMI Lambda), Texas Instruments (Explorer and MicroExplorer), and Xerox (Interlisp-D workstations). The operating systems were written in Lisp Machine Lisp, InterLisp (Xerox), and later partly in Common Lisp.Historical context[edit]\nArtificial intelligence (AI) computer programs of the 1960s and 1970s intrinsically required what was then considered a huge amount of computer power, as measured in processor time and memory space. The power requirements of AI research were exacerbated by the Lisp symbolic programming language, when commercial hardware was designed and optimized for assembly- and Fortran-like programming languages. At first, the cost of such computer hardware meant that it had to be shared among many users. But as integrated circuit technology shrank the size and cost of computers in the 1960s and early 1970s, and the memory requirements of AI programs started to exceed the address space of the most common research computer, the DEC PDP-10, researchers considered a new approach: a computer designed specifically to develop and run large artificial intelligence programs, and tailored to the semantics of the Lisp programming language. To keep the operating system (relatively) simple, these machines would not be shared, but would be dedicated to a single user[In 1973, Richard Greenblatt and Thomas Knight, programmers at MIT's AI Lab, started what would become the MIT Lisp Machine Project when they first began building a computer hardwired to run certain basic Lisp operations, rather than run them in software, in a 24-bit tagged architecture. The machine also did incremental (or \"Arena\") garbage collection.[citation needed] More specifically, since Lisp variables are typed at runtime rather than compile time, a simple addition of two variables could take five times as long on conventional hardware, due to test and branch instructions. Lisp Machines ran the tests in parallel with the more conventional single instruction additions. If the simultaneous tests failed, then the result was discarded and recomputed; this meant in many cases a speed increase by several factors. This simultaneous checking approach was used as well in testing the bounds of arrays when referenced, and other memory management necessities (not merely garbage collection or arrays).Type checking was further improved and automated when the conventional byte word of 32-bits was lengthened to 36-bits for Symbolics 3600-model Lisp machines[2] and eventually to 40-bits or more (usually, the excess bits not accounted for by the following were used for error-correcting codes). The first group of extra bits were used to hold type data, making the machine a tagged architecture, and the remaining bits were used to implement CDR coding (wherein the usual linked list elements are compressed to occupy roughly half the space), aiding garbage collection by reportedly an order of magnitude. A further improvement was two microcode instructions which specifically supported Lisp functions, reducing the cost of calling a function to (in some Symbolics implementations) as little as 20 clock cycles. The first machine was called the CONS machine (named after the list construction operator cons in Lisp). Often it was affectionately referred to as the \"Knight machine\", perhaps since Knight wrote his master's thesis on the subject; it was extremely well received.[citation needed] It was subsequently improved into a version called CADR (a pun; in Lisp, the cadr function, which returns the second element of a list, is pronounced /ˈkeɪ.dəɹ/ or /ˈkɑ.dəɹ/, as some pronounce the word \"cadre\") which was based on essentially the same architecture. About 25 of what were essentially prototype CADRs were sold within and without MIT for ~$50,000; it quickly became the favorite machine for hacking- many of the most favored software tools were quickly ported to it (e.g. Emacs was ported from ITS in 1975).

is a feminine given name. It is a German form of Katherine.[1] It may refer to:In television and film:In artistry:In other field. Katharina Thalbach comes from a particularly artistically oriented family. Her father Benno Besson was a director, her mother Sabine Thalbach was an actress. Her late husband Thomas Brasch was an author. Her daughter Anna (born 1973) and her granddaughter Nellie (born 1995) are also actresses, as are her half-brother Pierre Besson and her stepmother Ursula Karusseit.Katerina Petrova (Bulgarian: Катерина Петрова; English: Katherine Pierce), is a fictional character from the hit TV series, The Vampire Diaries. Born June 5, 1472,[1] Katherine is a doppelganger, descended from Amara and Tatia. She is an ex-vampire and the ex-lover to both the Salvatore brothers, Damon and Stefan. She first appears as Katherine Pierce in recurring flashbacks to 1864, which feature her romantic entanglements with the Salvatore brothers. She managed to turn them both into vampires, but she was concurrently was captured by the townspeople of Mystic Falls to be killed in Fells Church where they planned to lock the vampires in before setting it alight. She later appears in present day. Behind her sweet-nature facade, a much more calculating side of Katherine is revealed through flashbacks in which she escaped certain death with the help of George Lockwood, (at the expense of all the other vampires in town) in 1864. After 145 years, Katherine returns to Mystic Falls, toying with the Salvatores again and has a hidden agenda. Katherine earns no love after she turns Caroline Forbes into a vampire and uses a werewolf, Mason Lockwood, to retrieve a mysterious moonstone. Eventually she is exposed as a doppelgänger who has spent her immortal life fleeing from an Original vampire named Klaus. During Katherine's five centuries of life she became one of the most ruthless, notorious and infamous vampires in history. Katherine promises John Gilbert that she will help protect her descendant Elena Gilbert, even though the younger doppelgänger is her competition for the Salvatores' affections. She is initially portrayed as the main antagonist, but upon the arrival of Elijah, one of the Original vampires, Katherine is clearly terrified by the prospect of finally being caught by Klaus. Once she escapes at the end of the second season, she flees Mystic Falls almost immediately. Later returning to Mystic Falls in season 4 killing Elenas brother Jeremy to acquire a cure for vampirism negotiating a deal with Klaus for her freedom. This however backfires on her when Elena shoves the cure into her mouth, turning her human. Over the next season Katherine finds her long lost daughter, together they plant Katherine into Elena's body, but once Elena's friends discover this, she is stabbed to be extracted from Elena's body and she dies beside her daughter who dies just moments earlier from a hybrid bite.","path":[77280,9.09009,52.52306,73560,9.09009,52.52306,72300,9.09009,52.52306,71040,9.09009,52.52306,69840,9.08972,52.52307,68580,9.08972,52.52307,67320,9.08972,52.52307,66060,9.08972,52.52307,65100,9.089808,52.52305,64500,9.08987,52.52306,63120,9.08987,52.52306,60000,9.087675,52.52265,32520,8.991498,53.00294,31860,8.961365,53.00235,31560,8.945722,52.99783,31320,8.941756,53.00497,31140,8.933659,53.00906,30780,8.913388,53.01132,30240,8.886527,53.02127,30060,8.877238,53.02729,29880,8.86832,53.03161,29760,8.86594,53.03785,29580,8.868267,53.04293,29460,8.872169,53.04854,29340,8.874842,53.05376,29160,8.878866,53.05293,28500,8.879084,53.05241,27180,8.879084,53.05241,25860,8.879084,53.05241,24540,8.879084,53.05241,23220,8.879084,53.05241,21840,8.879084,53.05241,20460,8.879084,53.05241,19140,8.879084,53.05241,17760,8.879084,53.05241,16380,8.879084,53.05241,15060,8.879084,53.05241,13740,8.879084,53.05241,12420,8.879084,53.05241,11040,8.879084,53.05241,9660,8.879084,53.05241,8400,8.879084,53.05241,7080,8.879084,53.05241,5760,8.879084,53.05241,4380,8.879084,53.05241,3180,8.879084,53.05241,1800,8.879084,53.05241,480,8.879084,53.05241]},{"name":"NOVATRANS","text":"NOVATRANS:NovaTran (a parylene coater)Parylene development started in 1947, when Michael Szwarc discovered the polymer as one of the thermal decomposition products of a common solvent p-xylene at a temperatures exceeding 1000 °C. Szwarc first postulated the monomer to be para-xylylene, which he confirmed by reacting the vapors with iodine and observing the para-xylylene di-iodide as the only product. The reaction yield was only a few percent, and a more efficient route was found later by William F. Gorham at Union Carbide. He deposited parylene films by the thermal decomposition of [2.2] paracyclophane at temperatures exceeding 550 °C and in vacuum below 1 Torr. This process did not require a solvent and resulted in chemically resistant films free from pinholes.[33][34] Since the coating process takes place at ambient temperature in a mild vacuum, and because of parylene’s conformal properties, it has a wide variety of applications. Union Carbide commercialized a parylene coating system in 1965. Union Carbide went on to undertake research into the synthesis of numerous parylene precursors, including parylene AF-4, throughout the 1960s into the early 1970s. Union Carbide purchased NovaTran (a parylene coater) in 1984 and combined it with other electronic chemical coating businesses to form the Specialty Coating Systems division. The division was sold to Cookson Electronics in 1994.[35] Today there are several parylene coating service companies located around the

13","text":"LUESSEN 13:Lürssen (or Lürssen Werft) is a German shipbuilding company based in Bremen-Vegesack. Plant in Lemwerder. Plant in Schacht-Audorf (Rendsburg)\nLürssen designs and constructs yachts, naval ships and special vessels. Trading as Lürssen Yachts, it is one of the leading builders of custom superyachts such as Paul Allen's Octopus, David Geffen's Rising Sun, and Azzam, the largest private yacht in the world at 180m in length.[1]On June 27, 1875, the 24 year-old Friedrich Lürssen sets up a boatbuilding workshop in Aumund, near Bremen, Germany. His first vessel demonstrates his trademark: originality and high-quality. Friedrich Lürssen´s shipyard grows and thrives, and at one point he even begins placing orders with his father.11 years later, in 1886, Lürssen builds the world´s first motorboat. The 6-meter REMS is commissioned by the inventor and engine manufacturer Gottlieb Daimler, who needs a boat to put his new engine through its paces. Friedrich Lürssen, always open to new ideas, designs and builds it without delay. The Daimler engine that powers it has a cylinder capacity volumen of 0.462 liters, weighs 60 kilograms, and has an output 1.5 hp at 700 rpm. In 1907, Friedrich Lürssen´s only son, Otto, joins the firm as a partner, contributing far-reaching practical and theoretical knowledge. As a shipbuilding engineer, he combines tried and trusted craftsmanship with new technical expertise, improving on past techniques. This approach, handed down over the decades, remains to this day the essence of Lürssen´s unique quality and innovative spirit.Four years later the Lürssen-Daimler speedboat with its 102 hp engine becomes the sensation of the racing season. In the Mediterranean off Monaco, it wins the unofficial world championship, the Championship of the Sea. The speedboat goes on to win the Prix de la Cote d´Azur and the Grand Prix des Nations later in the same year.\n1916: The company that is his life´s work has grown into a leading German shipyard, when Friedrich Lürssen dies at the age of 65.

A year after Friedrich Lürssen´s death, the German navy started using remote-controlled boats to enter occupied ports or attacking heavily armored ships.

At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Electorate was enlarged to become the capital of the Kingdom of Hanover.From 1868 to 1946 Hanover was the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover and also of the Hanover administrative region until that was abolished in 2005. It is now the capital of the Land of Lower Saxony. Since 2001 it has been part of the Hanover district (Region Hannover), which is a municipal body made up from the former district (Landkreis Hannover) and city of Hanover (note: although both Region and Landkreis are translated as district they are not the same).With a population of 518,000, Hanover is a major centre of Northern Germany and the country's thirteenth largest city. Hanover also hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and the CeBIT. Every year Hanover hosts the Schützenfest Hannover, the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the Oktoberfest Hannover, the second largest such festival in Germany. In 2000, Hanover hosted the world fair Expo 2000. The Hanover fairground, due to numerous extensions, especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover is of national importance because of its universities and medical school, its international airport and its large zoo. The city is also a major crossing point of railway lines and highways (Autobahnen), connecting European main lines in both the east-west (Berlin–Ruhr area) and north-south (Hamburg–Munich, etc.) directions.\"Hanover\" is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopaedias prefer the German spelling,[3][4] and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites.[5] The English pronunciation /ˈhænəvər/, with stress on the first syllable and a reduced second syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation [haˈnoːfɐ], with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover.Hanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean \"high (river)bank\", though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.In the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built, as well as a city wall with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains, which increased the city's importance.In 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-Lüneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover.During the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714–1837), the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact, during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760–1837), there was only one short visit, by George IV in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover.During the Seven Years' War, the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation, leading to the city's occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year.After Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, George III did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain, where the King's German Legion was formed. It was the only German arm to fly against France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably.In 1827, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV's heir in the United Kingdom was female (Queen Victoria). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, Ernest Augustufs, and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza, Prussia employed Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business. The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth, and led to the recovery of the Gründerzeit (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 3139,400.In 1842 the first horse railway was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric tram was installed. In 1887 Hanover's Emile Berliner invented the record and the gramophone.After 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP (Nazi party). A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland, including the Grynszpan family. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Gryszpan's son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time. When he learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.[6]The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht.[7] It was in Hanover on 9 November 1938 that the synagogue, designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style, was burnt by the Nazis.In September 1941, through the \"Action Lauterbacher\" plan, a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the Wannsee Conference, on 15 December 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga.[8] A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover, in which many Jews were confined.[9] Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938, fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war.[citation needed] Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover. After the war a large group of Orthodox Jewish survivors of the nearby Bergen-Belsen concentration camp settled in Hanover.[10]As an important railroad and road junction and production center, Hanover was a major target for strategic bombing during World War II, including the Oil Campaign. Targets included the AFA (Stöcken), the Deurag-Nerag refinery (Misburg), the Continental plants (Vahrenwald and Limmer), the United light metal works (VLW) in Ricklingen and Laatzen (today Hanover fairground), the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant, the Hanomag factory (Linden) and the tank factory M.N.H. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen (Badenstedt). Forced labourers were sometimes used from the Hannover-Misburg subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp. Residential areas were also targeted, and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city center was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids.[11] After the war, the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial.The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945.[12] The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.[13]Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and became part of the new state (Land) of Lower Saxony in 1946.Today Hanover is a Vice-President City of Mayors for Peace, an international mayoral organisation mobilising cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.[14]Hanover experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb).One of the most famous sights is the Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen:The Great Garden is an important European baroque garden. The palace itself, however, was largely destroyed by Allied bombing but is currently under reconstruction.[citation needed] Some points of interest are the Grotto (the interior was designed by the French artist Niki de Saint-Phalle), the Gallery Building, the Orangerie and the two pavilions by Remy de la Fosse. The Great Garden consists of several parts. The most popular ones are the Great Ground and the Nouveau Jardin. At the centre of the Nouveau Jardin is Europe's highest garden fountain. The historic Garden Theatre inter alia hosted the musicals of the German rock musician Heinz Rudolf Kunze.[citation needed]The Berggarten is an important European botanical garden.[citation needed] Some points of interest are the Tropical House, the Cactus House, the Canary House and the Orchid House, which hosts one of the world's biggest collection of orchids, and free-flying birds and butterflies. Near the entrance to the Berggarten is the historic Library Pavillon. The Mausoleum of the Guelphs is also located in the Berggarten. Like the Great Garden, the Berggarten also consists of several parts, for example the Paradies and the Prairie Garden. There is also the Sea Life Centre Hanover, which is the first tropical aquarium in Germany.[citation needed]The Georgengarten is an English landscape garden. The Leibniz Temple and the Georgen Palace are two points of interest there.The landmark of Hanover is the New Town Hall (Neues Rathaus). Inside the building are four scale models of the city. A worldwide unique diagonal/arch elevator goes up the large dome to an observation deck.[citation needed]The Hanover Zoo is one of the most spectacular and best zoos in Europe. The zoo received the Park Scout Award for the fourth year running in 2009/10, placing it among the best zoos in Germany.[17] The zoo consists of several theme areas: Sambesi, Meyers Farm, Gorilla-Mountain, Jungle-Palace, and Mullewapp. Some smaller areas are Australia, the wooded area for wolves, and the so-called swimming area with many seabirds. There is also a tropical house, a jungle house, and a show arena. The new Canadian-themed area, Yukon Bay, opened in 2010. In 2010 the Hanover Zoo had over 1.6 million visitors.[17]Another point of interest is the Old Town. In the centre are the large Marktkirche (Church St. Georgii et Jacobi, preaching venue of the bishop of the Lutheran Landeskirche Hannovers) and the Old Town Hall. Nearby are the Leibniz House, the Nolte House, and the Beguine Tower. A very nice quarter of the Old Town is the Kreuz-Church-Quarter around the Kreuz Church with many nice little lanes. Nearby is the old royal sports hall, now called the Ballhof theatre. On the edge of the Old Town are the Market Hall, the Leine Palace, and the ruin of the Aegidien Church which is now a monument to the victims of war and violence. Through the Marstall Gate you arrive at the bank of the river Leine, where the world-famous Nanas of Niki de Saint-Phalle are located. They are part of the Mile of Sculptures, which starts from Trammplatz, leads along the river bank, crosses Königsworther Square, and ends at the entrance of the Georgengarten. Near the Old Town is the district of Calenberger Neustadt where the Catholic Basilica Minor of St. Clemens, the Reformed Church and the Lutheran Neustädter Hof- und Stadtkirche St. Johannis are located.Some other popular sights are the Waterloo Column, the Laves House, the Wangenheim Palace, the Lower Saxony State Archives, the Hanover Playhouse, the Kröpcke Clock, the Anzeiger Tower Block, the Administration Building of the NORD/LB, the Cupola Hall of the Congress Centre, the Lower Saxony Stock, the Ministry of Finance, the Garten Church, the Luther Church, the Gehry Tower (designed by the American architect Frank O. Gehry), the specially designed Bus Stops, the Opera House, the Central Station, the Maschsee lake and the city forest Eilenriede, which is one of the largest of its kind in Europe. With around 40 parks, forests and gardens, a couple of lakes, two rivers and one canal, Hanover offers a large variety of leisure activities.Since 2007 the historic Leibniz Letters, which can be viewed in the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library, are on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.Outside the city centre is the EXPO-Park, the former site of EXPO 2000. Some points of interest are the Planet M., the former German Pavillon, some nations' vacant pavilions, the Expowale, the EXPO-Plaza and the EXPO-Gardens (Parc Agricole, EXPO-Park South and the Gardens of change). The fairground can be reached by the Exponale, one of the largest pedestrian bridges in Europe.The Hanover fairground is the largest Exhibition Centre in the world.[18] It provides 496,000 square metres of covered indoor space, 58,000 square metres of open-air space, 27 halls and pavilions. Many of the Exhibition Centre's halls are architectural highlights. Furthermore, it offers the Convention Center with its 35 function rooms, glassed-in areas between halls, grassy park-like recreation zones and its own heliport.Two important sights on the fairground are the Hermes Tower (88.8 metres high) and the EXPO Roof, the largest wooden roof in the world.[19]In the district of Anderten is the European Cheese Centre, the only Cheese Experience Centre in Europe. Another tourist sight in Anderten is the Hindenburg Lock, which was the biggest lock in Europe at the time of its construction in 1928. The Tiergarten (literally the \"animals' garden\") in the district of Kirchrode is a large forest originally used for deer and other game for the king's table.In the district of Groß-Buchholz the 282-metre-high Telemax is located, which is the tallest building in Lower Saxony and the highest television tower in Northern Germany. Some other notable towers are the VW-Tower in the city centre and the old towers of the former middle-age defence belt: Döhrener Tower, Lister Tower and the Horse Tower.The 36 most important sights of the city centre are connected with a 4.2 kilometres (3 mi)-long red line, which is painted on the pavement. This so-called Red Thread marks out a walk that starts at the Tourist Information Office and ends on the Ernst-August-Square in front of the central station. There is also a guided sightseeing-bus tour through the city.The Historic Museum describes the history of Hanover, from the medieval settlement \"Honovere\" to the world-famous Exhibition City of today. The museum focuses on the period from 1714 to 1834 when Hanover had a strong relationship with the British royal house.With more than 4,000 members, the Kestnergesellschaft is the largest art society in Germany. The museum hosts exhibitions from classical modernist art to contemporary art. One big focus is put on film, video, contemporary music and architecture, room installments and big presentations of contemporary paintings, sculptures and video art.The Kestner-Museum is located in the House of 5.000 windows. The museum is named after August Kestner and exhibits 6,000 years of applied art in four areas: Ancient cultures, ancient Egypt, applied art and a valuable collection of historic coins.The KUBUS is a forum for contemporary art. It features mostly exhibitions and projects of famous and important artists from Hanover.The Kunstverein Hannover (Art Society Hanover) shows contemporary art and was established in 1832 as one of the first art societies in Germany. It is located in the Künstlerhaus (House of artists). There are around 7 international monografic and thematic Exhibitions in one year.The Lower Saxony State Museum is the largest museum in Hanover. The State Gallery shows the European Art from the 11th to the 20th century, the Nature Department shows the zoology, geology, botanic, geology and a Vivarium with fishes, insects, reptiles and amphibians.

MAERSK","text":"EUGEN MAERSK:Eugene is a common (masculine) first name that comes from the Greek εὐγενής (eugenēs), \"noble\", literally \"well-born\",[1] from εὖ (eu), \"well\"[2] and γένος (genos), \"race, stock, kin\".[3] Gene is a common shortened form. The feminine variant is Eugenia or Eugénie.Kim Yoo-jin (born March 3, 1981), professionally known as Eugene, is a South Korean singer, actress and presenter. She was a member of K-pop girl group S.E.S.. She has currently released two solo albums and has gone on to star in TV dramas and movies and work as an MC in various shows and programs.Eugene was born in Seoul, South Korea, but spent her childhood in Guam after moving there after elementary school. She attended Agueda I. Johnston Middle School from October 1992 until June 1995,[1] John F. Kennedy High School from June until September 1997. She returned to Korea with her mother and younger sister some time in high school, and eventually graduated from Korea Kent Foreign School, Seoul in June 1999.The Eugen Maersk is a container ship owned by the Danish shipping company Maersk. The eighth and newest of the Mærsk E-class, built in 2008, she and her seven sister ships are among the largest container ships ever built. She has a total TEU capacity of 11,000 TEU containers; however, with other ratings she can hold 13,500 containers. This rating goes by physical space rather than weight. Her beam is 183 feet (56 m), her length 1,302 feet (397 m), and she has a deadweight tonnage of 156,907.[1]The construction of this ship was the subject of a television documentary[2] on The Science Channel.On 19 June 2013, a fire broke out in a container onboard Eugen Maersk.[3]Summer 2016 Maersk Line to upgrade its eight E-class 15,550 teu vessels to load a further 1,300 teu. Maersk Line is upgrading its eight E-class 15,550 teu vessels to load a further 1,300 teu. Raising the accommodation block and wheelhouse and increasing the height of lashing bridges to take an extra tier of containers is part of the strategy to double the lifetime of the 10-year-old ships, and could be viewed as a statement from Maersk on maximum vessel size intent. Remedial work was needed on the Odense-built ships after the Emma Maersk was fortunate not to sink at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in early 2013 after the hull was fractured by a failed stern thruster. After the incident, Maersk prohibited the use of stern thrusters on its Emma-class ships until modifications could be made to the fleet. The upgrading, which also includes fitting a new bulbous bow to cope with slower speeds and a new propeller, is being carried out at China’s CSIC Qingdao Beihai Shipyard, which has undertaken the majority of previous Maersk Line ship upgrades. It is understood that the first E-class vessel converted was the Eugen Maersk, which has now rejoined the 2M AE1/Shogun Asia-North Europe loop.","path":[82320,7.340724,53.96223,82080,7.375142,53.96642,81900,7.404833,53.97,81720,7.436167,53.97383,81600,7.455777,53.9762,81420,7.479667,53.97867,81240,7.50959,53.98178,81120,7.533882,53.98435,80880,7.563667,53.98717,80700,7.5925,53.98967,80520,7.620718,53.98904,80400,7.6385,53.98483,80280,7.653833,53.978,80160,7.669,53.97017,80040,7.682667,53.96217,79920,7.696947,53.95396,79800,7.711017,53.9455,79680,7.723667,53.93683,79560,7.735667,53.928,79440,7.746833,53.91867,79320,7.758167,53.9095,79200,7.769333,53.90033,79080,7.781167,53.89167,78960,7.795068,53.8843,78840,7.812657,53.87976,78720,7.831713,53.87673,78600,7.850333,53.87383,78480,7.868824,53.87083,78360,7.888233,53.86782,78180,7.907735,53.86533,78000,7.935833,53.86183,77820,7.963666,53.85833,77640,7.990382,53.85488,77520,8.011621,53.85206,77400,8.029248,53.84876,77280,8.045082,53.84435,77160,8.059923,53.83967,77040,8.074395,53.83512,76920,8.0885,53.83067,76800,8.101833,53.826,76680,8.112667,53.81883,76440,8.1285,53.806,76260,8.144167,53.7935,76080,8.158667,53.782,75900,8.173667,53.77067,75720,8.191,53.75983,75600,8.204945,53.75139,75480,8.216875,53.74509,75240,8.240367,53.73523,75120,8.256227,53.72931,74880,8.279596,53.72055,74760,8.293738,53.71521,74580,8.309727,53.70913,74460,8.325735,53.70287,74280,8.340098,53.69465,74160,8.351666,53.687,73920,8.3695,53.674,73800,8.381166,53.66567,73620,8.395262,53.65679,73500,8.406261,53.65025,73320,8.420491,53.64388,73200,8.4355,53.6375,73020,8.448045,53.63213,72840,8.465357,53.62469,72720,8.477834,53.61934,72540,8.490205,53.61283,72420,8.495833,53.6085,72180,8.5025,53.60333,72000,8.505908,53.60103,71880,8.508667,53.59983,71760,8.510667,53.59983,71640,8.511666,53.59983,70800,8.512375,53.60003,68820,8.51239,53.60001,67380,8.512399,53.60004,66120,8.512359,53.60003,63600,8.512341,53.60001,62160,8.512412,53.59993,60900,8.51234,53.59999,59460,8.512368,53.6,58200,8.512333,53.6,56940,8.512333,53.6,55680,8.512333,53.6,54420,8.512386,53.60003,51180,8.512333,53.6,49560,8.51236,53.60001,48120,8.512333,53.6,46680,8.512382,53.6,45420,8.512333,53.6,44160,8.512362,53.6,42900,8.512383,53.60001,41640,8.51234,53.60004,40380,8.51237,53.59999,39120,8.512365,53.59997,37860,8.512373,53.60002,36240,8.512346,53.6,34800,8.512357,53.60001,33540,8.512333,53.6,32280,8.512392,53.60002,31020,8.512385,53.60004,29760,8.512359,53.60004,28500,8.512333,53.6,27240,8.512333,53.6,25980,8.512333,53.6,24720,8.512375,53.60005,23460,8.51235,53.60003,22200,8.512333,53.6,20940,8.51236,53.60003,19680,8.512333,53.6,18060,8.512333,53.6,16620,8.512363,53.60002,15360,8.512333,53.6,13920,8.512343,53.60003,12660,8.512326,53.60003,11400,8.512346,53.60001,10140,8.512368,53.60003,8880,8.512333,53.6,7620,8.512333,53.6,6360,8.512333,53.6,5100,8.512333,53.6,3840,8.512333,53.6,2580,8.512333,53.6,1320,8.512333,53.6]},{"name":"GLOVIS COMPANION","text":"GLOVIS COMPANION:is a Vehicles Carrier registered and sailing under the flag of Marshall Islands.

A member of the National Public Radio network, the station serves nearly 250,000 Northeast Texas homes. The staff is composed of radio professionals and also Texas A&M-Commerce students who major in either journalism or mass communication studies. KETR also produces original long-form and short-form radio programming. [1] KETR began in the early 1970s as the director of the East Texas State University radio-television program, Dr. David Rigney, developed an FCC application for an FM station that would be a teaching-laboratory for students. KETR's first broadcast went on the air on April 7, 1975. The station operated in a former classroom on the first floor of the Journalism Building, with Phil Ebensberger, a veteran Texas commercial radio broadcaster, as general manager and morning show host. The weekday programming originally emphasized local news, information and middle-of-the-road music from early-morning sign-on to early afternoon; classical music in the early afternoon (this was soon replaced by jazz); National Public Radio’s All Things Considered in the late afternoon; various public affairs programs in the early evening, including live broadcasts of Commerce City Commission meetings; and “Freeform,” a student-hosted rock music program from 9 p.m. to midnight. Weekend programs predominantly featured classical music or opera, such as the long-running “Texaco Metropolitan Opera” broadcasts.In 1977, the station moved from its quarters in the Journalism Building, to new studios in the Performing Arts Center, where it shared facilities with the Radio-TV program. KETR remained in the Performing Arts Center until it moved to new facilities in Binnion Hall in 2008. In the early 1980s, after Ebensberger departed, general manager Bill Oellermann obtained FCC approval and a grant to raise KETR’s tower height and to increase power from about 7,500 watts to 100,000 watts. This increased the station’s broadcast range from about 20 miles to 75 miles. After moving away from National Public Radio programming in the mid-1980s, KETR has recently rejoined NPR and once again features “All Things Considered” and “Morning Edition,” among other NPR programs.

until 27 September 1946 Barmbeck, is the name of a former village that was absorbed into the city of Hamburg, Germany. In 1951 it was divided into the quarters Barmbek-Süd, Barmbek-Nord and Dulsberg in the borough Hamburg-Nord.It was first recorded in 1271 as \"Bernebeke\". Up until 1946 it was written with a 'c' as Barmbeck. Barmbeck and Barmbek are pronounced with a long e, similar to the English \"Barm Bake\".

BOLTEN","text":"IRIS BOLTEN:In Greek mythology, Iris (/ˈaɪrᵻs/; Greek: Ἶρις)[1] is the personification of the rainbow and messenger of the gods. She is also known as one of the goddesses of the sea and the sky. Iris links the gods to humanity. She travels with the speed of wind from one end of the world to the other,[2] and into the depths of the sea and the underworld.According to Hesiod's Theogony, Iris is the daughter of Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra, and the sister of the Harpies: Aello and Ocypete.During the Titanomachy, Iris was the messenger of the Olympian Gods, while her twin sister Arke betrayed the Olympians and became the messenger of the Titans. Iris is frequently mentioned as a divine messenger in the Iliad which is attributed to Homer, but does not appear in his Odyssey, where Hermes fills that role. Like Hermes, Iris carries a caduceus or winged staff. By command of Zeus, the king of the gods, she carries an ewer of water from the River Styx, with which she puts to sleep all who perjure themselves. According to Apollonius Rhodius, Iris turned back the Argonauts Zetes and Calais who had pursued the Harpies to the Strophades ('Islands of Turning'). The brothers had driven off the monsters from their torment of the prophet Phineus, but did not kill them upon the request of Iris, who promised that Phineus would not be bothered by the Harpies again. Winged female figure holding a caduceus: Iris (messenger of the gods) or Nike (Victory)Iris is married to Zephyrus, who is the god of the west wind. Their son is Pothos (Nonnus, Dionysiaca). According to the Dionysiaca of Nonnos, Iris' brother is Hydaspes (book XXVI, lines 355-365).In Euripides' play Heracles, Iris appears alongside Lyssa, cursing Heracles with the fit of madness in which he kills his three sons and his wife Megara. In some records she is a sororal twin to the Titaness Arke (arch), who flew out of the company of Olympian gods to join the Titans as their messenger goddess during the Titanomachy, making the two sisters enemy messenger goddesses. Iris was said to have golden wings, whereas Arke had iridescent ones. She is also said to travel on the rainbow while carrying messages from the gods to mortals. During the Titan War, Zeus tore Arke's iridescent wings from her and gave them as a gift to the Nereid Thetis at her wedding, who in turn gave them to her son, Achilles, who wore them on his feet. Achilles was sometimes known as podarkes (feet like [the wings of] Arke.) Podarces was also the original name of Priam, king of Troy.Iris also appears several times in Virgil's Aeneid, usually as an agent of Juno. In Book 4, Juno dispatches her to pluck a lock of hair from the head of Queen Dido, that she may die and enter Hades. In book 5, Iris, having taken on the form of a Trojan woman, stirs up the other Trojan mothers to set fire to four of Aeneas' ships in order to prevent them from leaving

(Norwegian and Danish: Vikinger; Swedish and Nynorsk: Vikingar; Icelandic: Víkingar), from Old Norse víkingr, were Norse seafarers, speaking the Old Norse language, who raided and traded from their Scandinavian homelands across wide areas of northern, central and eastern Europe, during the late 8th to late 11th centuries.[1][2] The term is also commonly extended in modern English and other vernaculars to the inhabitants of Viking home communities during what has become known as the Viking Age. This period of Norse military, mercantile and demographic expansion constitutes an important element in the early medieval history of Scandinavia, the British Isles, Ireland, France, Kievan Rus' and Sicily.[3]Facilitated by advanced seafaring skills, and characterised by the longship, Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. Following extended phases of (primarily sea- or river-borne) exploration, expansion and settlement, Viking (Norse) communities and polities were established in diverse areas of north-western Europe, European Russia, the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America. This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture, while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself, with profound developmental implications in both directions.Popular, modern conceptions of the Vikings—the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia—often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from archaeology and historical sources. A romanticized picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival.[4][5] Perceived views of the Vikings as alternatively violent, piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century. Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clichés and stereotypes, complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy.One etymology derives víking from the feminine vík, meaning \"creek, inlet, small bay\".[6] Various theories have been offered that the word viking may be derived from the name of the historical Norwegian district of Viken (or Víkin in Old Norse), meaning \"a person from Viken\". According to this theory, the word simply described persons from this area, and it is only in the last few centuries that it has taken on the broader sense of early medieval Scandinavians in general. However, there are a few major problems with this theory. People from the Viken area were not called 'Viking' in Old Norse manuscripts, but are referred to as víkverir (Modern Norwegian: vikvær), 'Vík dwellers'. In addition, that explanation could only explain the masculine (Old Scandinavian víkingr) and ignore the feminine (Old Norse víking), which is a serious problem because the masculine is easily derived from the feminine but hardly vice versa.[7][8][9] The form also occurs as a personal name on some Swedish rune stones. There is little indication of any negative connotation in the term before the end of the Viking Age.Another etymology (supported by, among others, the recognized etymologist Anatoly Liberman [10]) derives viking from the same root as ON vika, f. ‘sea mile’, originally ‘the distance between two shifts of rowers’, from the root *weik or *wîk, as in the Proto-Germanic verb *wîkan, ‘to recede’. This is found in the Proto-Nordic verb *wikan, ‘to turn’, similar to Old Icelandic víkja (ýkva, víkva) ‘to move, to turn’, with well-attested nautical usages.[11] Linguistically, this theory is better attested,[11] and the term most likely predates the use of the sail by the Germanic peoples of North-Western Europe, because the Old Frisian spelling shows that the word was pronounced with a palatal k and thus in all probability existed in North-Western Germanic before that palatalization happened, that is, in the 5th century or before (in the western branch).[12][13] In that case, the idea behind it seems to be that the tired rower moves aside for the rested rower on the thwart when he relieves him. The Old Norse feminine víking (as in the phrase fara í víking) may originally have been a sea journey characterized by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A víkingr (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterized by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.[14]In Old English, the word wicing appears first in the Anglo-Saxon poem, Widsith, which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen written by Adam of Bremen in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved Middle English texts. The word Viking was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"barbarian warrior\" or noble savage. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer not only to seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like Iceland and the Faroe Islands), but secondarily to any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like Viking age, Viking culture, Viking art, Viking religion, Viking ship, and so on.[15]The Vikings were known as Ascomanni \"ashmen\" by the Germans for the ash wood of their boats,[16] Lochlannach (Lake Person) by the Gaels,[17] and Dene by the Anglo-Saxons.[18]The Slavs, the Arabs and the Byzantines knew them as the Rus' or Rhōs,[19] probably derived from various uses of rōþs-, \"related to rowing\", or derived from the area of Roslagen in east-central Sweden, where most of the Vikings who visited the Slavic lands came from. Some archaeologists and historians of today believe that these Scandinavian settlements in the Slavic lands played a significant role in the formation of the Kievan Rus' federation, and hence the names and early states of Russia and Belarus.[20][21][22] The modern day name for Sweden in several neighbouring countries is possibly derived from rōþs-, Ruotsi in Finnish and Rootsi in Estonian.The Slavs and the Byzantines also called them Varangians (Russian: варяги, from Old Norse Væringjar, meaning \"sworn men\", from vàr- \"confidence, vow of fealty,\" related to Old English wær \"agreement, treaty, promise,\" Old High German wara \"faithfulness\"[19]). Scandinavian bodyguards of the Byzantine emperors were known as the Varangian Guard.Anglo-Scandinavian is an academic term referring to the people, and archaeological and historical periods during the 8th to 13th centuries in which there was migration to—and occupation of—the British Isles by Scandinavian peoples generally known in English as Vikings. It is used in distinction from Anglo-Saxon. Similar terms exist for other areas, such as Hiberno-Norse for Ireland and Scotland.The period from the earliest recorded raids in the 790s until the Norman conquest of England in 1066 is commonly known as the Viking Age of Scandinavian history.[23] Vikings used the Norwegian Sea and Baltic Sea for sea routes to the south. The Normans were descended from Vikings who were given feudal overlordship of areas in northern France—the Duchy of Normandy—in the 10th century. In that respect, descendants of the Vikings continued to have an influence in northern Europe. Likewise, King Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, had Danish ancestors. Two Vikings even ascended to the throne of England, with Sweyn Forkbeard claiming the English throne from 1013-1014 and his son Cnut the Great becoming king of England from 1016-1035.[24][25][26][27][28]Geographically, a Viking Age may be assigned not only to Scandinavian lands (modern Denmark, Norway and Sweden), but also to territories under North Germanic dominance, mainly the Danelaw, including Scandinavian York, the administrative centre of the remains of the Kingdom of Northumbria,[29] parts of Mercia, and East Anglia.[30] Viking navigators opened the road to new lands to the north, west and east, resulting in the foundation of independent settlements in the Shetland, Orkney, and Faroe Islands; Iceland; Greenland;[31] and L'Anse aux Meadows, a short-lived settlement in Newfoundland, circa 1000.[32] They may have been deliberately sought out, perhaps on the basis of the accounts of sailors who had seen land in the distance. The Greenland settlement eventually died out, possibly due to climate change.[33] The Viking Rurik dynasty took control of territories in Slavic and Finno-Ugric-dominated areas of Eastern Europe; they annexed Kiev in 882 to serve as the capital of the Kievan Rus'.[34]As early as 839, when Swedish emissaries are first known to have visited Byzantium, Scandinavians served as mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine Empire.[35] In the late 10th century, a new unit of the imperial bodyguard formed. Traditionally containing large numbers of Scandinavians, it was known as the Varangian Guard. The word Varangian may have originated in Old Norse, but in Slavic and Greek it could refer either to Scandinavians or Franks. The most eminent Scandinavian to serve in the Varangian Guard was Harald Hardrada, who subsequently established himself as king of Norway (1047–66).There is archaeological evidence that Vikings reached Baghdad, the centre of the Islamic Empire.[36] The Norse regularly plied the Volga with their trade goods: furs, tusks, seal fat for boat sealant, and slaves. Important trading ports during the period include Birka, Hedeby, Kaupang, Jorvik, Staraya Ladoga, Novgorod, and Kiev.Generally speaking, the Norwegians expanded to the north and west to places such as Ireland, Scotland, Iceland, and Greenland; the Danes to England and France, settling in the Danelaw (northern/eastern England) and Normandy; and the Swedes to the east, founding Kievan Rus'. Among the Swedish runestones mentioning expeditions overseas, almost half tell of raids and travels to western Europe. According to the Icelandic sagas, many Norwegian Vikings also went to eastern Europe. In the Viking Age, the present day nations of Norway, Sweden and Denmark did not exist, but were largely homogeneous and similar in culture and language, although somewhat distinct geographically. The names of Scandinavian kings are reliably known only for the later part of the Viking Age. After the end of the Viking Age the separate kingdoms gradually acquired distinct identities as nations, which went hand-in-hand with their Christianization. Thus the end of the Viking Age for the Scandinavians also marks the start of their relatively brief Middle Ages.The Vikings explored the northern islands and coasts of the North Atlantic, ventured south to North Africa and east to Russia, Constantinople, and the Middle East.[21][22][37] They raided and pillaged, but also engaged in trade, settled wide-ranging colonies, and acted as mercenaries.[38] Vikings under Leif Ericson, heir to Erik the Red, reached North America and set up short-lived settlements in present-day L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, and Labrador, Canada.Viking expansion into continental Europe was limited. Their realm was bordered by powerful cultures to the south. Early on it was the Saxons, who occupied Old Saxony, located in what is now Northern Germany. The Saxons were a fierce and powerful people and were often in conflict with the Vikings. To counter the Saxon aggression and solidify their own presence, the Danes constructed the huge defence fortification of Danevirke in and around Hedeby.[39] The Vikings soon witnessed the violent subduing of the Saxons by Charlemagne, in the thirty-year Saxon Wars in 772-804. The Saxon defeat resulted in their forced christening and the absorption of Old Saxony into the Carolingian Empire. Fear of the Franks led the Vikings to further expand Danevirke, and the defence constructions remained in use throughout the Viking Age and even up until 1864.[40] The south coast of the Baltic Sea was ruled by the Obotrites, a federation of Slavic tribes loyal to the Carolingians and later the Frankish empire. The Vikings—led by King Gudfred—destroyed the Obotrite city of Reric on the southern Baltic coast in 808 AD and transferred the merchants and traders to Hedeby. This secured their supremacy in the Baltic Sea, which remained throughout the Viking Age.The motives driving the Viking expansion are a topic of much debate in Nordic history. One common theory posits that Charlemagne \"used force and terror to Christianise all pagans\", leading to baptism, conversion or execution, and as a result, Vikings and other pagans resisted and wanted revenge.[41][42][43][44][45] Professor Rudolf Simek states that \"it is not a coincidence if the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of Charlemagne\".[41][46] The penetration of Christianity into Scandinavia led to serious conflict dividing Norway for almost a century.[47]Another explanation is that the Vikings exploited a moment of weakness in the surrounding regions. England suffered from internal divisions and was relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers. Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted. The decline in the profitability of old trade routes could also have played a role. Trade between western Europe and the rest of Eurasia suffered a severe blow when the Roman Empire fell in the 5th century.[48] The expansion of Islam in the 7th century had also affected trade with western Europe.[49]Raids in Europe, including raids and settlements from Scandinavia, were not unprecedented and had occurred long before the Vikings arrived. The Jutes invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, pouring out from Jutland during the Age of Migrations, before the Danes settled there. The Saxons and the Angles did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.[50]During the Viking Age, Scandinavian men and women travelled to many parts of Europe and beyond, in a cultural diaspora that left its traces from Newfoundland to Byzantium. This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.[51] In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.By the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the Catholic Church (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.[52] By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.[53] Christianity had taken root in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at Lund, Scania, then part of Denmark.The assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so chattel slavery diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.The kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, Sigurd I of Norway sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established Kingdom of Jerusalem, and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the Baltic Crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries.[54]A variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on runestones. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.[55] Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.[56][57] The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.The most important primary sources on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.[58] Writing in Latin letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.[59] The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in runes, but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.Later writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval Christian culture in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the Icelandic sagas. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is of course doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of skaldic poetry attributed to court poets of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.Indirectly the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like Egilsay (from Eigils Ø meaning Eigil's Island), Ormskirk (from Ormr kirkja meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), Meols (from merl meaning Sand Dunes), Snaefell (Snow Fell), Ravenscar (Ravens Rock), Vinland (Land of Wine or Land of Winberry), Kaupanger (Market Harbour), Tórshavn (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of Odense, meaning a place where Odin was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the Tynwald on the Isle of Man. Common words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays (Thursday means Thor's day), axle, crook, raft, knife, plough, leather, berserk, bylaw, thorp, skerry, ombudsman, husband, heathen, Hell, Norman and ransack stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.[60] In the Northern Isles of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct Norn language. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as York (Horse Bay), Swansea (Sveinn's Isle) or some of the place names in Northern France like Tocqueville (Toki's farm).[61] Linguistic and etymological studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.[62][63] It has been speculated that several place names on the west coast of southern France might also stem from Viking activities.[64] Place names like Taillebourg (Trelleborg, meaning City of Thralls or Castle of Thralls) exist as far south as the Charente River.[65] Gascony and vicinity[66] is an active area of Viking archaeology at present.[67] A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Faroese and Icelandic.[68] Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the Slavic languages in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe. It has been speculated that the reason was the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus' Vikings more peaceful businesses in these areas and the fact that they were outnumbered. The Norse named some of the rapids on the Dnieper, but this can hardly be seen from the modern names.[69][70]A consequence of the available written sources, which may have coloured how the Viking age is perceived as a historical period, is that much more is known of the Vikings' activities in western Europe than in the East. One reason is that the cultures of north-eastern Europe at the time were non-literate, and did not produce a legacy of literature. Another is that the vast majority of written sources on Scandinavia in the Viking Age come from Iceland, a nation originally settled by Norwegian colonists. As a result, there is much more material from the Viking Age concerning Norway than Sweden, which apart from many runic inscriptions, has almost no written sources from the early Middle Ages.The Norse of the Viking Age could read and write and used a non-standardized alphabet, called runor, built upon sound values. While there are few remains of runic writing on paper from the Viking era, thousands of stones with runic inscriptions have been found where Vikings lived. They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of runor survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet.The majority of runic inscriptions from the Viking period are found in Sweden and date from the 11th century. The oldest stone with runic inscriptions was found in Norway and dates to the 4th century, suggesting that runic inscriptions pre-date the Viking period. Many runestones in Scandinavia record the names of participants in Viking expeditions, such as the Kjula runestone that tells of extensive warfare in Western Europe and the Turinge Runestone, which tells of a war band in Eastern Europe. Other runestones mention men who died on Viking expeditions. Among them are around 25 Ingvar runestones in the Mälardalen district of Sweden, erected to commemorate members of a disastrous expedition into present-day Russia in the early 11th century. Runestones are important sources in the study of Norse society and early medieval Scandinavia, not only of the Viking segment of the population.[71]The Jelling stones date from between 960 and 985. The older, smaller stone was raised by King Gorm the Old, the last pagan king of Denmark, as a memorial honouring Queen Thyre.[72] The larger stone was raised by his son, Harald Bluetooth, to celebrate the conquest of Denmark and Norway and the conversion of the Danes to Christianity. It has three sides: one with an animal image, one with an image of the crucified Jesus Christ, and a third bearing the following inscription:King Haraldr ordered this monument made in memory of Gormr, his father, and in memory of Thyrvé, his mother; that Haraldr who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christian.[73]Runestones attest to voyages to locations such as Bath,[74] Greece,[75] Khwaresm,[76] Jerusalem,[77] Italy (as Langobardland),[78] Serkland (i.e. the Muslim world),[79] England[80] (including London[81]), and various places in Eastern Europe. Viking Age inscriptions have also been discovered on the Manx runestones on the Isle of Man.There are numerous burial sites associated with Vikings throughout Europe and their sphere of influence—in Scandinavia, the British Isles, Ireland, Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands, Germany, The Baltic, Russia, etc.. The burial practices of the Vikings were quite varied, from dug graves in the ground, to tumuli, sometimes including so-called ship burials.According to written sources, most of the funerals took place at sea. The funerals involved either burial or cremation, depending on local customs. In the area that is now Sweden, cremations were predominant; in Denmark burial was more common; and in Norway both were common.[82] Viking barrows are one of the primary source of evidence for circumstances in the Viking Age.[83] The items buried with the dead give some indication as to what was considered important to possess in the afterlife.[84] It is unknown what mortuary services were given to dead children by the Vikings.[85] Some of the burial sites that are most important to our understanding of the Vikings include:There have been several archaeological finds of Viking ships of all sizes, providing knowledge of the craftsmanship that went into building them. There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the longship.[92] Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the Leidang, the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to go Viking, which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.[93][94]The Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The knarr was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the 'beitass', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.[95] It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.Ships were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at Gokstad and Oseberg in Norway[96] and the excavated ship burial at Ladby in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the Salme ships on the Estonian island of Saaremaa.[97]Well-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from Roskilde Fjord in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the knarr. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect Roskilde, then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde.The Viking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes of Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the Eddic poem of Rigsthula, which also explains that it was the God Ríg - father of mankind also known as Heimdallr - who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.[98]Thralls were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and the economy. Thralls were used as servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortresses, fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, enslaved and made them into thralls. The new thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'træl' and 'ty'.Karls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but employed thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.The Jarls were the aristocracy of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls or servants took care of most of the daily chores, while the Jarls engaged in administration, politics, hunting, sports, paid visits to other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes sacrificially killed and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.[99]In daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it is believed that there must have been some social mobility. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like hauldr, thegn, landmand, show mobility between the Karls and the Jarls.Other social structures included the communities of félag in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called félagi) were obliged. A félag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as drenge, one of the words for warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the Things.Women had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic Grágás and the Norwegian Frostating laws and Gulating laws.[100] The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as odalkvinna, all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man.[100] In the absence of male relatives, an unmarried woman with no son could inherit not only property but also the position as head of the family from a deceased father or brother. Such a woman was referred to as Baugrygr, and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, such as the right to demand and receive fines for the slaughter of a family member, until she married, by which her rights were transferred to her husband.[100] After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as maer and mey, reached legal majority and had the right to decide of her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law.[100] An exception to her independence was the right to choose a marriage partner, as marriages were normally arranged by the clan.[101] Widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women. A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry.[102] It was also socially acceptable for a free woman to cohabit with a man and have children with him without marrying him, even if that man was married; a woman in such a position was called frilla.[102] There was no distinction made between children born inside or outside of marriage: both had the right to inherit property after their parents, and there was no \"legitimate\" or \"illegitimate\" children.[102] Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (gydja) and oracles (sejdkvinna).[103] They were active within art as poets (skalder)[103] and rune masters, and as merchants and medicine women.[103] These liberties gradually disappeared after the introduction of Christianity, and from the late 13th-century, they are no longer mentioned.[100]The three classes were easily recognisable by their appearances. Men and women of the Jarls were well groomed with neat hairstyles and expressed their wealth and status by wearing expensive clothes (often silk) and well crafted jewellery like brooches, belt buckles, necklaces and arm rings. Almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see Viking art). Finger rings were seldom used and earrings were not used at all, as they were seen as a Slavic phenomenon. Most Karls expressed similar tastes and hygiene, but in a more relaxed and inexpensive way.[98][104]The sagas tell about the diet and cuisine of the Vikings,[105] but first hand evidence, like cesspits, kitchen middens and garbage dumps have proved to be of great value and importance. Undigested remains of plants from cesspits at Coppergate in York have provided a lot of information in this respect. Overall, archaeo-botanical investigations have been undertaken increasingly in recent decades, as a collaboration between archaeologists and palaeoethno-botanists. This new approach sheds new light on the agricultural and horticultural practices of the Vikings and therefore also on their cuisine.[106]When the information from various sources are put together, a picture of a diverse cuisine emerges, with lots of different ingredients. Meat products of all kinds, such as cured, smoked and whey-preserved meat,[107] sausages, and boiled or fried fresh meat cuts, were prepared and consumed.[108] There were plenty of seafood, bread, porridges, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, berries and nuts. Alcoholic drinks like beer, mead, bjórr (a strong fruit wine) and, for the rich, imported wine, were served.[109][110]Certain livestock were typical and unique to the Vikings, including the Icelandic horse, Icelandic cattle, a plethora of sheep breeds,[111] the Danish hen and the Danish goose.[112][113] The Vikings in York mostly ate beef, mutton, and pork with small amounts of horse meat. Most of the beef and horse leg bones were found split lengthways, to get out the marrow. The mutton and swine were cut into leg and shoulder joints and chops. The frequent remains of pig skull and foot bones found on house floors indicate that brawn and trotters were also popular. Hens were kept for both their meat and eggs, and the bones of game birds such as the black grouse, golden plover, wild ducks, and geese have also been found.[114]Seafood was an important part of the diet, in some places even more so than meat. Whales and walrus were hunted for food in Norway and the north-western parts of the North Atlantic region, and seals were hunted nearly everywhere. Oysters, mussels and shrimps were eaten in large quantities and cod and salmon were popular fish. In the southern regions, herring was also important.[115][116][117]Milk and buttermilk were popular, both as cooking ingredients and drinks, but were not always available, even at farms.[118] The milk came from cows, goats and sheep, with priorities varying from location to location,[119] and fermented milk products like skyr or surmjölk were produced as well as butter and cheese.[120]Food was often salted and enhanced with spices, some of which were imported like black pepper, while others were cultivated in herb gardens or harvested in the wild. Home grown spices that were used included caraway, mustard and horseradish as evidenced from the Oseberg ship burial[109] or dill, coriander, and wild celery, as found during the archaeological examinations of cesspits at Coppergate in York. Thyme, juniper berry, sweet gale, yarrow, rue and peppercress were also used and cultivated in herb gardens.[106][121]Vikings collected and ate fruits, berries and nuts. Apple (wild crab apples), plums and cherries were part of the diet,[122] as were rose hips and raspberry, wild strawberry, blackberry, elderberry, rowan, hawthorn and various wild berries, specific to the locations.[121] Hazelnuts were an important part of the diet in general and large amounts of walnut shells have been found in cities like Hedeby. The shells were used for dyeing and it is assumed the nuts were enjoyed as well.[106][118]The invention and introduction of the mouldboard plough revolutionized agriculture in Scandinavia in the early Viking Age and made it possible to farm even the poor soils. In Ribe, grains of rye, barley, oat and wheat dated to the 8th century have been found and examined, and these are believed to have been cultivated locally.[123] Grains and flour were used for making porridges, some cooked with milk, some cooked with fruit and sweetened with honey, and also various forms of bread. Remains of bread from primarily Birka in Sweden were made of barley and wheat. It is unclear if the Norse leavened their breads, but their ovens and baking utensils suggest that they did.[124] Flax was a very important crop for the Vikings. For oil extraction, food consumption and most importantly the production of linen. More than 40% of all known textile recoveries from the Viking Age can be traced as linen. This suggests a much higher actual percentage, as linen is poorly preserved compared to wool for example.[125]The quality of food for common people was not always particularly high. The research at Coppergate shows that the Vikings in York made bread from whole meal flour — probably both wheat and rye - but with the seeds of cornfield weeds included. Corncockle (Agrostemma), would have made the bread dark-coloured, but the seeds are poisonous, and people who ate the bread might have become ill. Seeds of carrots, parsnip, and brassicas were also discovered, but they were poor specimens and tend to come from white carrots and bitter tasting cabbages.[122] The rotary querns often used in the Viking Age inevitably left tiny stone fragments (often from basalt rock) in the flour and when eaten later on, these small stones wore down the teeth. The effects of this can be seen on skeletal remains of that period.[124]Sports were widely practised and encouraged by the Vikings.[126][127] Sports that involved weapons training and developing combat skills were popular. This included spear and stone throwing, building and testing physical strength through wrestling, fist fighting, and stone lifting. In areas with mountains, mountain climbing was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship's railing as it was being rowed. Swimming was a popular sport and Snorri Sturluson describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King Olaf Tryggvason was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of knife juggling as well.Skiing and ice skating were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter time and in the colder regions of the north.Horse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions.Icelandic sources refer to the sport of knattleik. A ball game akin to hockey, knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice. The rules are unclear, but it was popular with both adults and children, even though it often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.Hunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, deer, hares and foxes were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows. The techniques were stalking, snare and traps and par force hunting with dog packs.Both archaeological finds and written sources testify to the fact that the Vikings set aside time for social and festive gatherings.[126][127][128]Board games and dice games were played as a popular pastime at all levels of society. Preserved gaming pieces and boards show game boards made of easily available materials like wood, with game pieces manufactured from stone, wood or bone, while other finds include elaborately carved boards and game pieces of glass, amber, antler or walrus tusk, together with materials of foreign origin, such as ivory. The Vikings played several types of tafl games; hnefatafl, nitavl (Nine Men's Morris) and the less common kvatrutafl. Chess also appeared at the end of the Viking Age. Hnefatafl is a war game, in which the object is to capture the king piece—a large hostile army threatens and the king's men have to protect the king. It was played on a board with squares using black and white pieces, with moves made according to dice rolls. The Ockelbo Runestone shows two men engaged in Hnefatafl, and the sagas suggest that money or valuables could have been involved in some dice games.[126][128]On festive occasions storytelling, skaldic poetry, music and alcoholic drinks, like beer and mead, contributed to the atmosphere.[128] Music was considered an art form and music proficiency as fitting for a cultivated man. The Vikings are known to have played instruments including harps, fiddles, lyres and lutes.[126]Experimental archaeology of the Viking Age is a flourishing branch and several places have been dedicated to this technique, such as Jorvik Viking Centre in the United Kingdom, Sagnlandet Lejre and Ribe Viking Center (da) in Denmark, Foteviken Museum in Sweden or Lofotr Viking Museum in Norway. Viking-age reenactors have undertaken experimental activities such as iron smelting and forging using Norse techniques at Norstead in Newfoundland for example.[129]On 1 July 2007, the reconstructed Viking ship Skuldelev 2, renamed Sea Stallion,[130] began a journey from Roskilde to Dublin. The remains of that ship and four others were discovered during a 1962 excavation in the Roskilde Fjord. Tree-ring analysis has shown the ship was built of oak in the vicinity of Dublin in about 1042. Seventy multi-national crew members sailed the ship back to its home, and Sea Stallion arrived outside Dublin's Custom House on 14 August 2007. The purpose of the voyage was to test and document the seaworthiness, speed, and manoeuvrability of the ship on the rough open sea and in coastal waters with treacherous currents. The crew tested how the long, narrow, flexible hull withstood the tough ocean waves. The expedition also provided valuable new information on Viking longships and society. The ship was built using Viking tools, materials, and much the same methods as the original ship.Other vessels, often replicas of the Gokstad ship (full- or half-scale) or Skuldelev I have been built and tested as well. The Snorri (a Skuldelev I Knarr), was sailed from Greenland to Newfoundland in 1998.[131]Our knowledge about the arms and armour of the Viking age is based on archaeological finds, pictorial representation, and to some extent on the accounts in the Norse sagas and Norse laws recorded in the 13th century. According to custom, all free Norse men were required to own weapons and were permitted to carry them all the time. These arms were indicative of a Viking's social status: a wealthy Viking had a complete ensemble of a helmet, shield, mail shirt, and sword. A typical bóndi (freeman) was more likely to fight with a spear and shield, and most also carried a seax as a utility knife and side-arm. Bows were used in the opening stages of land battles and at sea, but they tended to be considered less \"honourable\" than a melee weapon. Vikings were relatively unusual for the time in their use of axes as a main battle weapon. The Húscarls, the elite guard of King Cnut (and later of King Harold II) were armed with two-handed axes that could split shields or metal helmets with ease.The warfare and violence of the Vikings were often motivated and fuelled by their beliefs in Norse religion, focusing on Thor and Odin, the gods of war and death.[132][133] In combat, it is believed that the Vikings sometimes engaged in a disordered style of frenetic, furious fighting known as berserkergang, leading them to be termed berserkers. Such tactics may have been deployed intentionally by shock troops, and the berserk-state may have been induced through ingestion of materials with psychoactive properties, such as the hallucinogenic mushrooms, Amanita muscaria,[134] or large amounts of alcohol.[135]The Vikings established and engaged in extensive trading networks throughout the known world and had a profound influence on the economic development of Europe and Scandinavia not the least.[136][137]Except for the major trading centres of Ribe, Hedeby and the like, the Viking world was unfamiliar with the use of coinage and was based on so called bullion economy. Silver was the most common metal in the economy, although gold was also used to some extent. Silver circulated in the form of bars, or ingots, as well as in the form of jewellery and ornaments. Traders carried small scales, enabling them to measure weight very accurately, so it was possible to have a very precise system of trade and exchange, even without a regular coinage.[136]Organized trade covered everything from ordinary items in bulk to exotic luxury products. The Viking ship designs, like that of the knarr, were an important factor in their success as merchants.[138] Imported goods from other cultures included:[139]To counter these valuable imports, the Vikings exported a large variety of goods. These goods included:[139]Other exports included weapons, walrus ivory, wax, salt and cod. As one of the more exotic exports, hunting birds were sometimes provided from Norway to the European aristocracy, from the 10th century.[147]Many of these goods were also traded within the Viking world itself, as well as goods such as soapstone and whetstone. Soapstone was traded with the Norse on Iceland and in Jutland, who used it for pottery. Whetstones were traded and used for sharpening weapons, tools and knives.[139] There are indications from Ribe and surrounding areas, that the extensive medieval trade with oxen and cattle from Jutland (see Ox Road), reach as far back as c. 720 AD. This trade satisfied the Vikings' need for leather and meat to some extent, and perhaps hides for parchment production on the European mainland. Wool was also very important as a domestic product for the Vikings, to produce warm clothing for the cold Scandinavian and Nordic climate, and for sails. Sails for Viking ships required large amounts of wool, as evidenced by experimental archaeology. There are archaeological signs of organized textile productions in Scandinavia, reaching as far back as the early Iron Ages. Artisans and craftsmen in the larger towns were supplied with antlers from organized hunting with large-scale reindeer traps in the far north. They were used as raw material for making everyday utensils like combs.[147]In England the Viking Age began dramatically on 8 June 793 when Norsemen destroyed the abbey on the island of Lindisfarne. The devastation of Northumbria's Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York.[148] Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".[149] More than any other single event, the attack on Lindisfarne demonised perception of the Vikings for the next twelve centuries. Not until the 1890s did scholars outside Scandinavia begin to seriously reassess the achievements of the Vikings, recognizing their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.[150]Norse Mythology, sagas, and literature tell of Scandinavian culture and religion through tales of heroic and mythological heroes. Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the Icelanders Snorri Sturluson and Sæmundur fróði. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.The 200-year Viking influence on European history is filled with tales of plunder and colonization, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the Nestor chronicles, Novgorod chronicles, Ibn Fadlan chronicles, Ibn Rusta chronicles, and brief mentions by Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the Byzantine Empire. Other chroniclers of Viking history include Adam of Bremen, who wrote, in the fourth volume of his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum, \"[t]here is much gold here (in Zealand), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called wichingi by their own people, and Ascomanni by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the Battle of Maldon between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of Maldon in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.Early modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (Olaus Magnus, 1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the Edda (notably Peder Resen's Edda Islandorum of 1665).In Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars Thomas Bartholin and Ole Worm and the Swede Olaus Rudbeck used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was George Hicke, who published his Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus in 1703–05. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.The word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by Erik Gustaf Geijer in his poem, The Viking. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of Romanticism in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The Geatish Society, of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was Esaias Tegnér, member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna, which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.Fascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called Viking revival in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of Romantic nationalism. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"Wagnerian\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries Scandinavism. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. The new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to grapple with the primary Icelandic sagas.[151]Until recently, the history of the Viking Age was largely based on Icelandic sagas, the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus, the Russian Primary Chronicle, and Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib. Few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources, as historians now rely more on archaeology and numismatics, disciplines that have made valuable contributions toward understanding the period.[152]The romanticised idea of the Vikings constructed in scholarly and popular circles in northwestern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries was a potent one, and the figure of the Viking became a familiar and malleable symbol in different contexts in the politics and political ideologies of 20th-century Europe.[153] In Normandy, which had been settled by Vikings, the Viking ship became an uncontroversial regional symbol. In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by Richard Wagner. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.[154] Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in Nazi Germany as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of Nazi mysticism. Other political organizations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling, similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda. In communist Russia, the ideology of Slavic racial purity led to the complete denial that Scandinavians had played a part in the emergence of the principalities of the Rus', which were supposed to have been founded by Slavs. Evidence to the contrary was suppressed until the 1990s. Novgorod now enthusiastically acknowledges its Viking history and has included a Viking ship in its logo.[155]Led by the operas of German composer Richard Wagner, such as Der Ring des Nibelungen, Vikings and the Romanticist Viking Revival have inspired many creative works. These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as Frans Gunnar Bengtsson's The Long Ships (which was also released as a 1963 film), and historical fantasies such as the film The Vikings, Michael Crichton's Eaters of the Dead (movie version called The 13th Warrior), and the comedy film Erik the Viking. The vampire Eric Northman, in the HBO TV series True Blood, was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the Danish American writer Poul Anderson, while British explorer, historian, and writer Tim Severin authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world.In 1962, American comic book writer Stan Lee and his brother Larry Lieber, together with Jack Kirby, created the Marvel Comics superhero Thor, which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011 Marvel Studios film Thor and its sequel Thor: The Dark World and also appears in the 2012 film The Avengers and its associated animated series.Since the 1960s, there has been rising enthusiasm for historical reenactment. While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy, the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors has increased. The largest such groups include The Vikings and Regia Anglorum, though many smaller groups exist in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Many reenactor groups participate in live-steel combat, and a few have Viking-style ships or boats.The Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League are so-named owing to the large Scandinavian population in the US state of Minnesota.Modern reconstructions of Viking mythology have shown a persistent influence in late 20th- and early 21st-century popular culture in some countries, inspiring comics, role-playing games, computer games, and music, including Viking metal, a subgenre of heavy metal music.Apart from two or three representations of (ritual) helmets—with protrusions that may be either stylised ravens, snakes, or horns—no depiction of the helmets of Viking warriors, and no preserved helmet, has horns. The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side.Historians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th-century enthusiasts of Götiska Förbundet, founded in 1811 in Stockholm.[156] They promoted the use of Norse mythology as the subject of high art and other ethnological and moral aims.The Vikings were often depicted with winged helmets and in other clothing taken from Classical antiquity, especially in depictions of Norse gods. This was done to legitimize the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealized in European culture.The latter-day mythos created by national romantic ideas blended the Viking Age with aspects of the Nordic Bronze Age some 2,000 years earlier. Horned helmets from the Bronze Age were shown in petroglyphs and appeared in archaeological finds (see Bohuslän and Vikso helmets). They were probably used for ceremonial purposes.[157]Cartoons like Hägar the Horrible and Vicky the Viking, and sports kits such as those of the Minnesota Vikings and Canberra Raiders have perpetuated the myth of the horned helmet.[158]Viking helmets were conical, made from hard leather with wood and metallic reinforcement for regular troops. The iron helmet with mask and mail was for the chieftains, based on the previous Vendel-age helmets from central Sweden. The only true Viking helmet found is from Gjermundbu in Norway. This helmet is made of iron and has been dated to the 10th century.[159]The image of wild-haired, dirty savages sometimes associated with the Vikings in popular culture is a distorted picture of reality.[2] Viking tendencies were often misreported, and the work of Adam of Bremen, among others, told largely disputable tales of Viking savagery and uncleanliness.[160]There is no evidence that Vikings drank out of the skulls of vanquished enemies. This was a misconception based on a passage in the skaldic poem Krákumál speaking of heroes drinking from ór bjúgviðum hausa (branches of skulls). This was a reference to drinking horns, but was mistranslated in the 17th century[161] as referring to the skulls of the slain.[162]Studies of genetic diversity provide some indication of the origin and expansion of the Viking population. Haplogroup I-M253 (defined by specific genetic markers on the Y-chromosome) mutation occurs with the greatest frequency among Scandinavian males: 35 percent in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, and peaking at 40 percent within western Finland.[163] It is also common near the southern Baltic and North Sea coasts, and then successively decreasing further to the south geographically.Female descent studies show evidence of Norse descent in areas closest to Scandinavia, such as the Shetland and Orkney islands.[164] Inhabitants of lands farther away show most Norse descent in the male Y-chromosome lines.[165]A specialised genetic and surname study in Liverpool demonstrated marked Norse heritage: up to 50 percent of males who belonged to original families, those who lived there before the years of industrialization and population expansion.[166] High percentages of Norse inheritance—tracked through R-M420 haplotype signatures—were also found among males in the Wirral and West Lancashire.[167] This was similar to the percentage of Norse inheritance found among males in the Orkney Islands.[168]Recent research suggests that the Celtic warrior Somerled, who drove the Vikings out of western Scotland and was the progenitor of Clan Donald, may have been of Viking descent, a member of haplogroup

C","text":"BERNE C:The copyright law of Chile is governed by Law No. 17,336, on Intellectual Property of October 2 of 1970 and subsequent amendments. It was implemented in the Decree No. 1122 of the Ministry of Education of Chile on May 17 of 1971. This law aims to protect the economic and moral rights of Chilean authors and foreigners residing in Chile, granted by the mere fact of creating works that are literary, artistic and scientific. It states that foreign authors who aren't domiciled in the country enjoy the protection that is recognized by the international conventions that Chile has signed and ratified.History[edit]The Constitution of Chile of 1833 stipulated in Article 152 that \"Every author or inventor shall have exclusive ownership of his discovery or production ..\" resulting in the act Literary and Artistic Property of July 24 of 1834 being passed.It was replaced by Decree Law No. 345, Intellectual Property, of May 5 of 1925.In turn, the 1950 Act 9.549 extended the copyright duration after the death of the author to fifty years.[citation needed]In 1970, Chile signed and ratified the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works which states, among other principles, that the protection of the works should not be conditional upon compliance with any formality requirements.Before it was due to issue a new law compatible with the international treaty, the Chilean government enacted Law No. 17,336, on Intellectual Property of October 2 of 1970 which, repealed the previous legislation on the subject.Types of works[edit]Although the law provides a list of protected works, it is not exhaustive.Books, pamphlets, articles and writings.Conferences, speeches, lectures, reports, reviews, etc., both written or recorded versions. Dramatic, dramatic-musical and theater in general, pantomimes and choreographic. Music.

Adaptations, translations and other transformations, when authorized by the original author of the work if it is not in the public domain\nVideo and slide shows. Software. Types of rights[edit]. The types of rights under Chilean law is divided in two:Moral rights consists in the recognition of authorship of the work, being able to oppose any changes, keep the work unpublished, and so on. These rights are inalienable and not transferable, but can be transmitted to the surviving spouse and heirs.Property rights consist of the use of the work, whether its publication, reproduction, adaptation, translation or processing performance. These rights can be transferred to third parties after permission of the author or rights holder. Duration of protection[edit]The protection of copyright in Chile is for the life of the author and 70 years after his death.Originally, the Law No. 17,336 established an extension of 30 years, which was amended in 1992, increasing that period to 50 years after the death of the author. In turn, this duration was increased again in 2003 by Law No. 19,914, to 70 years. Article 10 of Law 17,336 provides that if there is a spouse or unmarried daughters or widows whose spouse or affected by an inability to perform any kind of work, this period will extend until the date of death last of the survivors.Public domain[edit] Law No. 17,336, recognizes the existence of public domain. These works of the common cultural heritage can be used by anyone, provided they mention the authorship of the work and respect the integrity of the work.Included in this type of work common cultural heritage of the following: Works whose term of protection has been extinguished. Works of unknown authorship, including the songs, legends, dances and expressions of folklore. Works whose holders waived the protection afforded by this law. Works of foreign authors, residing abroad, who are not protected by copyright laws abroad or in Chile. Works expropriated by the state, unless a beneficiary is specified by law.

The C-130J is a comprehensive update of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, with new engines, flight deck, and other systems. The Hercules family has the longest continuous production run of any military aircraft in history. During more than 60 years of service, the family has participated in military, civilian, and humanitarian aid operations. The Hercules has outlived several planned successor designs, most notably the Advanced Medium STOL Transport contestants. Fifteen nations have placed orders for a total of 300 C-130Js, of which 250 aircraft have been delivered as of February 2012[update].[5]The C-130J is the newest version of the Hercules and the only model still in production. Externally similar to the classic Hercules in general appearance, the J-model features considerably updated technology. These differences include new Rolls-Royce AE 2100 D3 turboprops with Dowty R391[6] composite scimitar propellers, digital avionics (including head-up displays (HUDs) for each pilot), and reduced crew requirements. These changes have improved performance over its C-130E/H predecessors, such as 40% greater range, 21% higher maximum speed, and 41% shorter takeoff distance.[7] The J-model is available in a standard-length or stretched -30 variant.As a cargo and airlift aircraft, the C-130J's crew includes two pilots and one loadmaster (no navigator or flight engineer), while specialized USAF variants (e.g., AC-130J, EC-130J, MC-130J, HC-130J, WC-130J) may have larger crews, such as navigators/Combat Systems Officers or other specialized officer and enlisted air crew. The U.S. Marine Corps KC-130J uses a crew chief for expeditionary operations. The C-130J's cargo compartment is approximately 41 feet (12.5 m) long, 9 feet (2.74 m) high, and 10 feet (3.05 m) wide, and loading is from the rear of the fuselage. The aircraft can also be configured with the \"enhanced cargo handling system\". The system consists of a computerized loadmaster's station from which the user can remotely control the under-floor winch and also configure the flip-floor system to palletized roller or flat-floor cargo handling. Initially developed for the USAF, this system enables rapid role changes to be carried out and so extends the C-130J's time available to complete taskings.[8]Lockheed Martin received the launch order for the J-model from the RAF, which ordered 25 aircraft, with first deliveries beginning in 1999 as Hercules C4 (C-130J-30) and Hercules C5 (C-130J). The standard C-130J had a flyaway cost of US$62 million in 2008.[9]In mid-June 2008, the United States Air Force awarded a $470 million contract to Lockheed Martin for six modified KC-130J aircraft for use by the Air Force and Special Operations Command. The contract led to C-130J variants that will replace aging HC-130s and MC-130s.[10] The HC-130J Combat King II personnel recovery aircraft completed developmental testing on 14 March 2011. The final test point was air-to-air refueling, and was the first ever boom refueling of a C-130 where the aircraft’s refueling receiver was installed during aircraft production. This test procedure also applied to the MC-130J Combat Shadow II aircraft in production for Air Force Special Operations Command.[11]With the addition of the Marine Corps's ISR / Weapon Mission Kit, the KC-130J tanker variant will be able to serve as an overwatch aircraft and can deliver ground support fire in the form of Hellfire or Griffin missiles, precision-guided bombs, and eventually 30mm cannon fire in a later upgrade.[12] This capability, designated as \"Harvest HAWK\" (Hercules Airborne Weapons Kit), can be used in scenarios where precision is not a requisite, such as area denial.[13] The aircraft retains its original capabilities in refueling and transportation. The entire system can be removed within a day if necessary.[14]The Super Hercules has been used extensively by the USAF and USMC in Iraq and Afghanistan. Canada has also deployed its CC-130J aircraft to Afghanistan.C-130Js from several countries have been deployed in support of the US Operation Odyssey Dawn and NATO's Operation Unified Protector during the 2011 Libyan civil war.From the first flight on 5 April 1996 to 30 April 2013, 290 C-130J Super Hercules aircraft operated by 13 nations surpassed 1 million flight hours.[15][16]In January 2013, it was reported that some of Canada's C-130J transports had counterfeit Chinese microchips in their cockpit displays. These parts are more likely to fail and result in failures such as blank instrument screens during flight. A 14-month investigation by the U.S Senate armed services committee concluded that counterfeit parts in the Hercules and other American-made military equipment are prone to failure with potentially \"catastrophic consequences.\" The U.S. congressional investigation reported the fake Hercules microchips were originally made by the Korean electronics giant Samsung in the 1990s, and more than a decade later, had been recycled, refurbished and remarked to appear genuine by a company in China.[17] Samsung later stated that \"it is not possible to project the reliability\" of the altered parts. The U.S. investigation reported that the problems on the Hercules first came to light in 2010 when the instrument panel failed on a USAF aircraft during active duty.[18]On 20 August 2013, the Indian Air Force performed the highest landing of a C-130J at the Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip in Ladakh at the height of 16,614 ft (5,064 m).[19][20]The Modular Airborne FireFighting System (MAFFS) is a self-contained unit used for aerial firefighting that can be loaded onto a C-130 Hercules, which then allows the aircraft to be used as an air tanker against wildfires.[21] This allows the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to utilize military aircraft from the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to serve as an emergency backup resource to the civilian air tanker fleet.[21][22] The latest generation MAFFS II system was used for the first time on a fire in July 2010,[23] using the C-130J Super Hercules.[24] The 146th Airlift Wing was the first to transition to the MAFFS II system in 2008, and it remains the only unit flying the new system on the C-130J aircraft.[24]The largest operator of the new model is the U.S. Air Force, which has ordered the aircraft in increasing numbers. Current operators of the C-130J are the USAF (including the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard), United States Marine Corps (being their fourth variant after KC-130F, KC-130R and KC-130T,[25]) United States Coast Guard, Royal Air Force, Indian Air Force, Royal Canadian Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force, Royal Danish Air Force, Royal Norwegian Air Force, Israeli Air Force, and the Italian Air Force. As of July 2010, a total of 200 units have been produced[26] of the 284 on order at that time.[27]Australia was the second international customer for the C-130J-30, with an initial order of twelve aircraft. An additional order for two more aircraft was planned, but canceled with the purchase of a fifth Boeing C-17 Globemaster III.[28]The Royal Norwegian Air Force ordered four C-130J-30s in 2007 to replace six aging C-130Hs in need of additional repairs.[29][30] Aircraft were delivered from November 2008[31][32] to 2010.[33] One of these was lost in March 2012.The Canadian Forces signed a US$1.4 billion contract with Lockheed Martin for seventeen new C-130J-30s on 16 January 2008, as part of the procurement process to replace the existing C-130E and H models.[34] The C-130J will be officially designated CC-130J Hercules in Canadian service.[35] The first C-130J was delivered to CFB Trenton on 4 June 2010.[36] The final C-130J was delivered on 11 May 2012.[37]The Indian Air Force purchased six C-130J-30s in early 2008 at a cost of up to US$1.059 billion[38] for its special operations forces in a package deal with the US government under its Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. India has options to buy six more aircraft.[39] The Indian government decided not to sign the Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), which resulted in the exclusion of high precision GPS and other sensitive equipment. However the IAF added similar equipment produced indigenously to the aircraft after delivery.[40] In October 2011, India announced its intent to exercise the option for the six additional aircraft, following the C-130J's favorable performance in the 2011 Sikkim earthquake relief operations. In July 2012, the U.S. accepted India's request for the six more C-130Js through the FMS program.[41] On 20 December 2013, India's CCS approved the order for 6 more aircraft.[42]The Iraqi Air Force ordered six C-130J-30s in July 2008.[43][44]Qatar ordered four C-130Js in October 2008, along with spare parts and training for the Qatar Emiri Air Force. The contract is worth a total of US$393.6 million and deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2011.[45]The United Arab Emirates Air Force announced an order for twelve C-130J transports at the 2009 IDEX, with an announced value of US$1.3 billion.[46] The United Arab Emirates requested 12 C-130Js through a Direct Commercial Sale in December 2009, with logistics support, training and related systems to be provided through a Foreign Military Sales program.[47] A contract with Lockheed Martin has not been signed.[48]The Israeli Air Force is seeking to purchase nine C-130J-30s.[49] In April 2010 Israel ordered one C-130J-30 with delivery in 2013, and was in contract talks for two more aircraft in June 2010.[N 1][50] An option for a second C-130J-30 was exercised on 8 April 2011, along with planning and advance long lead procurement of aircraft components to support the third C-130J Israeli aircraft.[51][52] The first Israeli C-130J was delivered on 26 June 2013 and was modified with Israeli-unique systems in the United States[16] prior to its arrival in Israel on 9 April 2014.[53] Israel ordered a fourth C-130J-30 on 25 July 2013.[54] The C-130J's local name is \"Shimshon\".The Kuwait Air Force signed a contract for three KC-130J air refueling tankers in May 2010, with deliveries to begin in late 2013.[55] The KC-130Js will refuel its F-18s and augment its fleet of three militarized L-100s.Oman increased its C-130J order in August 2010 by adding two C-130Js to the single C-130J-30 ordered in 2009. Deliveries are to be completed by early 2014.[56] The Royal Saudi Air Force has purchased[when?] two KC-130Js to be delivered in 2016.[citation needed]The Mexican Government has requested 2 C-130J-30s.[57]The Mongolian Air Force is planning to buy 3 C-130Js.[58]On 7 June 2013, U.S. Congress was notified of a possible foreign military sale of two C-130J-30s for the Free Libyan Air Force. The deal would include 10 Rolls-Royce AE 2100D3 engines, support and test equipment, and radios. The deal would be worth $588 million.[59]In July 2013, the C-130J became part of a competition in the Peruvian Air Force for a medium transport aircraft. The Super Hercules was a candidate along with the EADS CASA C-295, the Alenia C-27J Spartan, the Antonov An-70, and the upgraded Antonov An-32.[60] The Peruvian Air Force selected the C-27J in November 2013.[61]In 2015 the French Air Force ordered 4 Super Hercules to supplement existing capabilities due to the ongoing problems and delayed entry into services of the ordered Airbus A400M, through FMS the French will get 2 C-130J in 2017/2018 and 2 2 KC-130J in 2018/2019 (Helicopter refuelling capability), especially supporting French overseas operations in Africa.In May 2016 rumours emerged that the German Air Force was considering to buy up to 10 C-130J Hercules to acquire tactical airlift capabilities due to the delayed entry into service of the Airbus A400M (like the French Air Force ordering 4 in 2015) and to supplement the planned Airbus A400M Fleet, based on the size & capabilities of both aircraft.C-130Js have been involved in the following notable accidents.Specifications are for basic J-model; data for C-130J-30 noted.Data from USAF C-130 Hercules fact sheet,[103] International Directory of Military Aircraft,[104] Encyclopedia of Modern

HIGHWAY","text":"HAMBURG HIGHWAY:Hamburg (/ˈhæmbɜːrɡ/; German pronunciation: [ˈhambʊʁk] ( listen), local pronunciation [ˈhambʊɪ̯ç] ( listen); Low German/Low Saxon: Hamborg - [ˈhambɔːx] ( listen)), officially Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union.[6] It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the Hamburg Metropolitan Region (including parts of the neighbouring Federal States of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein) has more than 5 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe. The official name reflects its history as a member of the medieval Hanseatic League, as a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire, a city-state, and one of the 16 states of Germany. Before the 1871 Unification of Germany, it was a fully sovereign state. Prior to the constitutional changes in 1919, the civic republic was ruled by a class of hereditary grand burghers or Hanseaten. Hamburg is a transport hub, being the 2nd largest port in Europe, and is an affluent city in Europe. It has become a media and industrial centre, with plants and facilities belonging to Airbus, Blohm + Voss and Aurubis. The radio and television broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk and publishers such as Gruner + Jahr and Spiegel-Verlag are pillars of the important media industry in Hamburg. Hamburg has been an important financial centre for centuries, and is the seat of the world's second oldest bank, Berenberg Bank.The city is a notable tourist destination for both domestic and overseas visitors; it ranked 16th in the world for livability in 2015.The ensemble Speicherstadt and Kontorhausviertel was declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO in July 2015.Hamburg is on the southern point of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the north-east. It is on the River Elbe at its confluence with the Alster and Bille. The city centre is around the Binnenalster (\"Inner Alster\") and Außenalster (\"Outer Alster\"), both formed by damming the River Alster to create lakes. The island of Neuwerk and two small neighbouring islands Scharhörn and Nigehörn, in the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park, are also part of Hamburg.The neighbourhoods of Neuenfelde, Cranz, Francop and Finkenwerder are part of the Altes Land (old land) region, the largest contiguous fruit-producing region in Central Europe. Neugraben-Fischbek has Hamburg's highest elevation, the Hasselbrack at 116.2 metres (381 ft) AMSL. The name Hamburg comes from the first permanent building on the site, a castle which the Emperor Charlemagne ordered constructed in AD 808. It rose on rocky terrain in a marsh between the River Alster and the River Elbe as a defence against Slavic incursion, and acquired the name Hammaburg, burg meaning castle or fort. The Medieval Hamburg[edit]\nIn 834, Hamburg was designated as the seat of a bishopric. The first bishop, Ansgar, became known as the Apostle of the North. Two years later, Hamburg was united with Bremen as the Bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen.[18]Hamburg was destroyed and occupied several times. In 845, 600 Viking ships sailed up the River Elbe and destroyed Hamburg, at that time a town of around 500 inhabitants.[18] In 1030, King Mieszko II Lambert of Poland burned down the city. Valdemar II of Denmark raided and occupied Hamburg in 1201 and in 1214. The Black Death killed at least 60% of the population in 1350.[19] Hamburg experienced several great fires, most notably in 1284.In 1189, by imperial charter, Frederick I \"Barbarossa\" granted Hamburg the status of an Imperial Free City and tax-free access up[clarification needed] the Lower Elbe into the North Sea. In 1265, an allegedly forged letter was presented to or by the Rath of Hamburg.[20] This charter, along with Hamburg's proximity to the main trade routes of the North Sea andorigin of the Hamma term remains uncertain,[16] as does the exact location of the castle. Baltic Sea, quickly made it a major port in Northern Europe. Its trade alliance with Lübeck in 1241 marks the origin and core of the powerful Hanseatic League of trading cities. On 8 November 1266, a contract between Henry III and Hamburg's traders allowed them to establish a hanse in London. This was the first time in history that the word hanse was used for the trading guild of the Hanseatic League.[21] In 1270, the solicitor of the senate of Hamburg, Jordan von Boitzenburg, wrote the first description of civil, criminal and procedural law for a city in Germany in the German language, the Ordeelbook (Ordeel: sentence).[22] On 10 August 1410, civil unrest forced a compromise (German: Rezeß, literally meaning: withdrawal). This is considered the first constitution of Hamburg.[23] In 1529, the city embraced Lutheranism, and it received Reformed refugees from the Netherlands and France.Modern times[edit]\nWhen Jan van Valckenborgh introduced a second layer to the fortifications to protect against the Thirty Years War in the seventeenth century, he extended Hamburg and created a \"New Town\" (Neustadt) whose street names still date from the grid system of roads he introduced.[24]Upon the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Free Imperial City of Hamburg was not incorporated into a larger administrative area while retaining special privileges (mediatised), but became a sovereign state with the official title of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. Hamburg was briefly annexed by Napoleon I to the First French Empire (1804–1814/1815). Russian forces under General Bennigsen finally freed the city in 1814. Hamburg re-assumed its pre-1811 status as a city-state in 1814. The Vienna Congress of 1815 confirmed Hamburg's independence and it became one of 39 sovereign states of the German Confederation (1815–1866).n 1842, about a quarter of the inner city was destroyed in the \"Great Fire\". The fire started on the night of 4 May and was not extinguished until 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and many other buildings, killing 51 people and leaving an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years.After periodic political unrest, particularly in 1848, Hamburg adopted in 1860 a democratic constitution that provided for the election of the Senate, the governing body of the city-state, by adult taxpaying males. Other innovations included the separation of powers, the separation of Church and State, freedom of the press, of assembly and association. Hamburg became a member of the North German Confederation (1866–1871) and of the German Empire (1871–1918), and maintained its self-ruling status during the Weimar Republic (1919–1933). The city experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the 19th century, when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as the growth of the city's Atlantic trade helped make it Europe's second-largest port. The Hamburg-America Line, with Albert Ballin as its director, became the world's largest transatlantic shipping company around the start of the 20th century. Shipping companies sailing to South America, Africa, India and East Asia were based in the city. Hamburg was the departure port for many Germans and Eastern Europeans to emigrate to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Trading communities from all over the world established themselves there. A major outbreak of cholera in 1892 was badly handled by the city government, which retained an unusual degree of independence for a German city.

Kugelbake (German: Ball Beacon) is a historic aid to navigation in the city of Cuxhaven, Germany, at the northernmost point of Lower Saxony, where the River Elbe flows into the North Sea. In the Low German dialect of the Middle Ages, the term bake referred to all navigational aids – including lighthouses. About 30 meters (100 feet) high and built of wood, the Kugelbake is the principal landmark of Cuxhaven; since 1913, it has been depicted on the city's coat of arms. Large wooden structures guiding mariners have stood on this spot for over 300 years.[1][2]The Kugelbake stands at a busy shipping lane in the Cuxhaven borough of Döse and was once a vital nautical landmark. At this point, the estuary is about 18 km wide. Geographically speaking, the Elbe ends here and the North Sea begins. From a nautical point of view, the Kugelbake can be said to separate the Outer and Lower portions of the Elbe. It is also regarded as the symbolic separation between the Elbe and Weser estuaries. Its distinctive design, well known to skippers, is now a popular tourist destination.[3]The first navigational aid was built on this spot around 1703 at the instigation of the Pilot Inspector Paul Allers after an existing bearing, a group of trees, was swept away by a fierce storm surge. It was constructed of wood and had a short service life due to the harsh weather and floods common on the point. It was rebuilt approximately every 30 years, the first reconstruction taking place around 1737.[5]In 1853, the Kugelbake was lit nightly to guide ships in the difficult curvature of the estuary. The light consisted of a fire in a small hut located inside the structure. By 1878 the light served only as a reserve because a lightvessel was placed in the channel throughout the year. At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the light was reduced to confuse potential enemies and in World War I it was completely removed for the same reason. In 1924 it was rebuilt, but instead of the eponymous ball, two round perpendicular composite discs were attached at the top. The current construction was built after 1945.[6]The Kugelbake was also the spot where amateur radio pioneer Jonathan Zenneck experimented with radio communications between the Mainland and ships at sea during the winter of 1899–1900. A wooden hut was built within the structure, equipped with the necessary antennas and technical equipment for the very first coastal radio station in Germany.[5] The first transmissions were sent between the Kugelbake and the steamship Silvana to a distance of 32 km. In the autumn of 1900, transmissions were sent as far as the Elbe Islands and Heligoland, 63 km away.[7]In 2001 the Wasser- und Schifffahrtsverwaltung (English: Water and Shipping Administration) transferred the Kugelbake to the federal historic properties agency, since the beacon had lost its nautical importance. A foundation was established for the preservation of this historic landmark, which since 2002 has belonged to the city of Cuxhaven.[2][5]A Ro-Ro vessel MV Kugelbake was built in 2009 for container traffic on the Elbe, registered at Cuxhaven. It has crew of 6, a displacement of 3900 metric tons, is 79.3 m long and 18.6 m wide, and is equipped with a 1900 kW power plant.[8]Kugelbake as seen from the tidal flatsLighthouses and day marks in the Elbe estuary (1831)Coordinates: 53°53′30.6″N 08°41′13.8″E﻿ / ﻿53.891833°N 8.687167°E﻿ / 53.891833; 8.687167","path":[82440,8.822528,53.83708,82200,8.805556,53.83731,82080,8.79473,53.83747,81960,8.784687,53.83968,81720,8.770985,53.84396,81600,8.762345,53.84786,81420,8.750858,53.85379,81240,8.74215,53.85836,81060,8.732725,53.86335,80940,8.723615,53.86897,80700,8.712793,53.87589,80580,8.70722,53.88057,80400,8.700933,53.88735,80280,8.69569,53.89295,80040,8.687034,53.90236,79800,8.677495,53.91221,79620,8.670042,53.92005,79440,8.663007,53.92743,79320,8.656848,53.93416,79140,8.646294,53.94112,78960,8.639073,53.94477,78660,8.618103,53.95232,78360,8.597778,53.95828,78000,8.571054,53.96305,77760,8.552974,53.96499,77460,8.529643,53.96763,77100,8.501268,53.97078,76860,8.482799,53.9729,76560,8.456663,53.97608,76260,8.431662,53.97874,75960,8.409055,53.98102,75600,8.377481,53.98374,75360,8.35851,53.98577,75060,8.332862,53.9883,74700,8.29754,53.99052,74520,8.28389,53.99049,74400,8.272173,53.99029,74280,8.262198,53.98977,74100,8.250435,53.98895,73920,8.235275,53.98748,73800,8.221505,53.9857,73620,8.209389,53.98311,73440,8.197068,53.98015,73320,8.18568,53.97745,73140,8.173877,53.97472,72900,8.153852,53.96995,72780,8.144326,53.9677,72660,8.134757,53.96541,72540,8.125807,53.96323,72420,8.116333,53.96097,72240,8.105989,53.95834,72060,8.090997,53.95472,72060,8.090997,53.95472,71820,8.07406,53.95055,71640,8.05972,53.94715,71520,8.04986,53.94477,71400,8.041067,53.94264,71280,8.031181,53.94033,71100,8.021274,53.93795,70920,8.007493,53.93475,70680,7.990648,53.93053,70500,7.978688,53.92745,70380,7.975902,53.92095,70260,7.983346,53.91715,70140,7.993132,53.91383,69900,8.007936,53.90897,69780,8.01849,53.90551,69660,8.027337,53.90265,69540,8.036945,53.89956,69360,8.047783,53.89619,69180,8.06223,53.89169,69060,8.072144,53.88861,69060,8.072144,53.88861,68940,8.081471,53.88568,68820,8.09114,53.88253,68580,8.104733,53.87729,68460,8.110532,53.87096,68220,8.117146,53.86168,62580,8.376248,53.67172,60840,8.480643,53.61886,60660,8.49025,53.6134,60360,8.50423,53.60386,60180,8.513577,53.59665,60000,8.522721,53.5883,59820,8.53021,53.58105,59700,8.5367,53.57415,59520,8.54358,53.56664,59340,8.551305,53.55842,59160,8.556595,53.55275,58980,8.564198,53.5445,58800,8.568976,53.53578,58680,8.567146,53.52963,58560,8.561392,53.52463,58440,8.55271,53.52079,58200,8.538743,53.51522,58080,8.532679,53.51323,57960,8.529246,53.51292,57840,8.529457,53.51412,56580,8.529748,53.51438,55140,8.529752,53.51437,53700,8.529745,53.51437,52260,8.529752,53.51437,51000,8.529754,53.51438,49740,8.529741,53.51438,48480,8.529748,53.51437,47220,8.529745,53.51438,45960,8.529743,53.51439,44700,8.529763,53.51438,43440,8.52975,53.51438,42180,8.529752,53.51437,40920,8.529747,53.51437,39660,8.529755,53.51437,38400,8.529745,53.51437,37140,8.529752,53.51437,35880,8.529755,53.51437,34620,8.529752,53.51437,33360,8.529745,53.51438,32100,8.529747,53.51438,30840,8.52975,53.51437,29580,8.529757,53.51437,28320,8.529757,53.51438,27060,8.529757,53.51438,25800,8.529752,53.51437,24540,8.529761,53.51438,23280,8.529752,53.51438,21840,8.529747,53.51437,20580,8.529752,53.51437,19320,8.529752,53.51437,18060,8.529741,53.51437,16800,8.529748,53.51437,15540,8.529738,53.51439,14280,8.529743,53.51438,13020,8.52975,53.51438,11580,8.529747,53.51437,10320,8.529747,53.51437,8700,8.529743,53.51437,7260,8.529752,53.51438,6000,8.529748,53.51438,4740,8.52975,53.51437,3480,8.529738,53.51439,2220,8.52975,53.51438,960,8.529741,53.51437]},{"name":"TRAVETANK","text":"TRAVETANK:Trave river.Construction of the first prototype began in February 1944 and was completed in less than 6 weeks.[4] The initial prototype was officially titled Bunteboot (but better known as Adam) was heavily influenced by the British Welman submarine.[4] It differed from the final design in a number of respects such as being nearly 2 meters shorter.[4] Following testing on the Trave river on 29 May twenty four Bibers were ordered.[4]The Biber (German for \"beaver\") was a German midget submarine of the Second World War.

The Biber was hastily developed to help meet the threat of an Allied invasion of Europe. This resulted in basic technical flaws that, combined with the inadequate training of their operators, meant they never posed a real threat to Allied shipping, despite 324 submarines being delivered.

According to the Hebrew Bible, he was a former Egyptian prince who later in life became a religious leader and lawgiver, to whom the authorship of the Torah, or acquisition of the Torah from Heaven is traditionally attributed. Also called Moshe Rabbenu in Hebrew (מֹשֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ, lit. \"Moses our Teacher\"), he is the most important prophet in Judaism.[3][4] He is also an important prophet in Christianity, Islam, Bahá'ísm as well as a number of other faiths. According to the Book of Exodus, Moses was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies.[5] Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites. Through the Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile river and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slavemaster (because the slavemaster was smiting a Hebrew to death), Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered The Angel of the Lord,[6] speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb (which he regarded as the Mountain of God). God sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery. Moses said that he could not speak with assurance or eloquence,[7] so God allowed Aaron, his brother, to become his spokesperson. After the Ten Plagues, Moses led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. After 40 years of wandering in the desert, Moses died within sight of the Promised Land.According to archaeologist William G. Dever, scholarly consensus sees Moses as a legendary figure and not a historical person.[8] Archaeological evidence does not support a mass-migration from Egypt, as described in the Bible. Rabbinical Judaism calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391–1271 (120 years) BCE;[9] Jerome gives 1592 BCE,[10] and James Ussher 1571 BCE as his birth year.[11][a]The Biblical account of Moses' birth provides him with a folk etymology to explain the ostensible meaning of his name.[14][15] He is said to have received it from the Pharaoh's daughter: \"he became her son. She named him Moses (Moshe), saying, \"I drew him out (meshitihu) of the water.\"[16][17] This explanation links it to a verb mashah, meaning \"to draw out\", which makes the Pharaoh's daughter's declaration a play on words.[17][18] The princess made a grammatical mistake which is prophetic of his role in his future life, as someone who will \"draw the people of Israel out of Egypt through the waters of the Red Sea.\"[19]Several etymologies have been proposed. An Egyptian root msy, 'child of', has been considered as a possible etymology, arguably an abbreviation of a theophoric name, as for example in Egyptian names like Thutmoses (Thoth created him) and Ramesses (Ra created him),[14] with the god's name omitted. Abraham Yahuda, based on the spelling given in the Tanakh, argues that it combines 'water' or 'seed' and 'pond, expanse of water', thus yielding the sense of \"child of the Nile\" (mw-še).The Hebrew etymology in the Biblical story may reflect an attempt to cancel out traces of Moses' Egyptian origins.[19] The Egyptian character of his name was recognized as such by ancient Jewish writers like Philo of Alexandria and Josephus.[19] Philo linked Mōēsēs (Μωησής) to the Egyptian (Coptic) word for water (mou/μῶυ), while Josephus, in his Antiquities of the Jews, claimed that the second element, -esês, meant 'those who are saved'. The problem of how an Egyptian princess, known to Josephus as Thermutis (identified as Tharmuth)[17] and in later Jewish tradition as Bithiah,[21] could have known Hebrew puzzled medieval Jewish commentators like Abraham ibn Ezra and Hezekiah ben Manoah, known also as Hizkuni. Hizkuni suggested she either converted or took a tip from Jochebed.[22][23]","path":[82560,8.509809,53.50381,81300,8.509831,53.50387,80040,8.509855,53.5039,78780,8.509855,53.50394,77520,8.509895,53.50387,76260,8.509873,53.50389,75000,8.509845,53.50387,73740,8.50986,53.5039,72480,8.509875,53.50392,71220,8.509829,53.50387,69960,8.509847,53.50388,68700,8.509856,53.50382,67440,8.509827,53.50391,66180,8.509809,53.50393,64920,8.509843,53.50386,63660,8.509855,53.50388,62400,8.509862,53.50386,61140,8.50984,53.50387,59700,8.51102,53.50413,59580,8.511925,53.50471,59280,8.514528,53.50583,59160,8.516791,53.50654,59040,8.520975,53.50801,58860,8.526557,53.51046,58740,8.533479,53.51361,58560,8.541023,53.5169,58440,8.549675,53.52065,58260,8.558407,53.52445,58140,8.565585,53.52955,58020,8.567451,53.53569,57780,8.562658,53.54457,57660,8.557495,53.55008,57420,8.549459,53.55827,57300,8.544022,53.56387,57060,8.535365,53.57263,56880,8.525247,53.58072,56700,8.518673,53.58607,56400,8.50885,53.59657,56280,8.50323,53.60066,56100,8.495995,53.60585,41100,7.539907,53.89947,40860,7.52577,53.89788,40680,7.512252,53.89602,40560,7.502622,53.89468,40380,7.491578,53.89314,40200,7.480552,53.89162,40080,7.470282,53.89022,39900,7.459533,53.88869,39780,7.449395,53.88724,39600,7.439845,53.88588,39480,7.429105,53.8843,39300,7.41687,53.88254,39120,7.4075,53.88118,39000,7.397457,53.87972,38880,7.388015,53.87836,38700,7.376445,53.87671,38520,7.365088,53.87509,38340,7.353878,53.87346,38220,7.34374,53.87201,38040,7.334427,53.87067,37920,7.323962,53.86919,37740,7.313941,53.86772,37620,7.303936,53.86618,37380,7.29003,53.86398,37260,7.281388,53.86284,37140,7.272845,53.86181,36900,7.258293,53.86013,36720,7.246942,53.85878,36600,7.23631,53.85751,36420,7.226449,53.85635,36240,7.216158,53.85508,36120,7.204628,53.85366,35940,7.19429,53.8524,35820,7.185039,53.85129,35640,7.175611,53.85016,35520,7.166564,53.84907,35340,7.156185,53.84781,35160,7.145758,53.84656,34980,7.134068,53.84513,34860,7.124558,53.84396,34740,7.115585,53.84291,34560,7.104767,53.8416,34380,7.095518,53.84051,34260,7.086308,53.83942,34080,7.07749,53.83834,33960,7.067584,53.83716,33780,7.058473,53.83607,33660,7.05008,53.83508,33480,7.040894,53.83378,33360,7.03165,53.83273,33180,7.023327,53.83183,33060,7.013905,53.8307,32940,7.005075,53.82965,32760,6.99404,53.82835,32580,6.983075,53.8271,32400,6.975308,53.82616,32280,6.96681,53.82515,32100,6.95761,53.82403,31980,6.947775,53.82291,31800,6.939373,53.8219,31680,6.930138,53.82083,31500,6.919113,53.81953,31380,6.910003,53.81846,31200,6.900295,53.81732,31020,6.890725,53.8162,30900,6.881947,53.81519,30660,6.868132,53.81355,30540,6.859167,53.8125,30360,6.849157,53.81131,30240,6.841162,53.81028,30060,6.833307,53.80934,29880,6.822857,53.80813,29760,6.813917,53.80712,29640,6.805638,53.80622,29460,6.79713,53.80524,29340,6.788064,53.80418,29160,6.779223,53.80314,29040,6.769417,53.80199,28860,6.760447,53.80096,28680,6.748303,53.79955,28560,6.739145,53.79853,28320,6.728122,53.79723,28200,6.718781,53.79613,27960,6.706182,53.79465,27780,6.696865,53.79352,27600,6.686922,53.79238,27420,6.67612,53.79117,27300,6.667115,53.79013,27120,6.657493,53.78899,26880,6.64514,53.78753,19320,6.19299,53.71125,18960,6.17178,53.70717,18600,6.149378,53.7023,18360,6.134167,53.69908,18120,6.11831,53.69577,17940,6.10827,53.69365,17760,6.096147,53.69113,17520,6.079903,53.68783,17340,6.069672,53.68575,17160,6.058575,53.68346,17040,6.050035,53.68167,16860,6.041155,53.67992,16740,6.033615,53.67841,16620,6.026675,53.67701,16500,6.019303,53.67551,16320,6.009002,53.67329,16200,6.000108,53.67147,16020,5.991107,53.66961,15840,5.9792,53.66708,15720,5.970593,53.66536,15600,5.962752,53.66371,15360,5.946875,53.66064,15300,5.946875,53.66064,15120,5.934122,53.65813,15000,5.926175,53.65656,14820,5.912312,53.65384,14700,5.904473,53.65231,14580,5.896791,53.65073,14340,5.884642,53.64832,14160,5.873075,53.64609,13980,5.8602,53.64349,13800,5.847227,53.64091,13620,5.835832,53.63869,13440,5.8241,53.63638,13320,5.814427,53.63455,13200,5.80649,53.63301,13080,5.797887,53.63135,12960,5.79025,53.62988,12840,5.783452,53.62861,12720,5.775935,53.62709,12540,5.767418,53.62547,12360,5.755078,53.62311,12360,5.755078,53.62311,12240,5.745185,53.62117,12000,5.731908,53.61867,11880,5.721598,53.61658,11700,5.712137,53.61476,11520,5.699128,53.61226,11400,5.690587,53.61051,11280,5.681593,53.60866,11040,5.668655,53.6061,10920,5.658102,53.60403,10620,5.64195,53.60086,10500,5.631355,53.59871,10380,5.623452,53.59713,10260,5.614972,53.59548,10140,5.6073,53.59407,10020,5.599605,53.59261,9840,5.587828,53.59045,9720,5.57886,53.58881,9600,5.570498,53.58721,9420,5.561543,53.58543,9240,5.548857,53.58299,9120,5.539912,53.5812,9000,5.531997,53.57965,8880,5.52418,53.57807,8760,5.515843,53.57654,8640,5.507482,53.57501,8520,5.49937,53.5735,8400,5.490527,53.57203,8160,5.476617,53.56967,8040,5.46704,53.56805,7920,5.458958,53.56658,7800,5.450745,53.56522,7560,5.435613,53.56264,7440,5.424335,53.56082,7320,5.415905,53.55949,7140,5.407084,53.55798,6960,5.394752,53.55549,6780,5.383003,53.55307,6660,5.3746

CGM AMBER","text":"CMA CGM AMBER:Amber is fossilized tree resin (not sap), which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since Neolithic times.[2] Much valued from antiquity to the present as a gemstone, amber is made into a variety of decorative objects.[3] Amber is used as an ingredient in perfumes, as a healing agent in folk medicine, and as jewelry.\nThere are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions. Amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite, and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within New Zealand coal seams.[4]The English word amber derives from Arabic ʿanbar عنبر[5] (cognate with Middle Persian ambar[6]) via Middle Latin ambar and Middle French ambre. The word was adopted in Middle English in the 14th century as referring to what is now known as ambergris (ambre gris or \"grey amber\"), a solid waxy substance derived from the sperm whale. In the Romance languages, the sense of the word had come to be extended to Baltic amber (fossil resin) from as early as the late 13th century. At first called white or yellow amber (ambre jaune), this meaning was adopted in English by the early 15th century. As the use of ambergris waned, this became the main sense of the word.[5]The two substances (\"yellow amber\" and \"grey amber\") conceivably became associated or confused because they both were found washed up on beaches. Ambergris is less dense than water and floats, whereas amber is too dense to float, though less dense than stone.[7]The classical names for amber, Latin electrum and Ancient Greek ἤλεκτρον (ēlektron), are connected to a term ἠλέκτωρ (ēlektōr) meaning \"beaming Sun\".[8][9] According to myth, when Phaëton son of Helios (the Sun) was killed, his mourning sisters became poplar trees, and their tears became elektron, amber.[10]Amber is discussed by Theophrastus in the 4th century BC, and again by Pytheas (c. 330 BC) whose work \"On the Ocean\" is lost, but was referenced by Pliny the Elder, according to whose The Natural History (in what is also the earliest known mention of the name Germania):[11]Pytheas says that the Gutones, a people of Germany, inhabit the shores of an estuary of the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory extending a distance of six thousand stadia; that, at one day's sail from this territory, is the Isle of Abalus, upon the shores of which, amber is thrown up by the waves in spring, it being an excretion of the sea in a concrete form; as, also, that the inhabitants use this amber by way of fuel, and sell it to their neighbors, the Teutones.Earlier[12] Pliny says that a large island of three days' sail from the Scythian coast called Balcia by Xenophon of Lampsacus, author of a fanciful travel book in Greek, is called Basilia by Pytheas. It is generally understood to be the same as Abalus. Based on the amber, the island could have been Heligoland, Zealand, the shores of Bay of Gdansk, the Sambia Peninsula or the Curonian Lagoon, which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern Europe. It is assumed that there were well-established trade routes for amber connecting the Baltic with the Mediterranean (known as the \"Amber Road\"). Pliny states explicitly that the Germans export amber to Pannonia, from where it was traded further abroad by the Veneti. The ancient Italic peoples of southern Italy were working amber, the most important examples are on display at the National Archaeological Museum of Siritide to Matera. Amber used in antiquity as at Mycenae and in the prehistory of the Mediterranean comes from deposits of Sicily.Pliny also cites the opinion of Nicias, according to whom amber \"is a liquid produced by the rays of the sun; and that these rays, at the moment of the sun's setting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of the soil, leave upon it an unctuous sweat, which is carried off by the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of Germany.\" Besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is \"produced by the Sun\", Pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin, citing the native Latin name of succinum (sūcinum, from sucus \"juice\").[13] \"Amber is produced from a marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine genus, like gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is a liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities, and is gradually hardened [...] Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice of a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of 'succinum' and one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine genus, is the fact that it emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, and that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance of torch-pine wood.\"He also states that amber is also found in Egypt and in India, and he even refers to the electrostatic properties of amber, by saying that \"in Syria the women make the whorls of their spindles of this substance, and give it the name of harpax [from ἁρπάζω, \"to drag\"] from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and the light fringe of tissues.\"Pliny says that the German name of amber was glæsum, \"for which reason the Romans, when Germanicus Cæsar commanded the fleet in those parts, gave to one of these islands the name of Glæsaria, which by the barbarians was known as Austeravia\". This is confirmed by the recorded Old High German glas and Old English glær for \"amber\" (c.f. glass). In Middle Low German, amber was known as berne-, barn-, börnstēn. The Low German term became dominant also in High German by the 18th century, thus modern German Bernstein besides Dutch Dutch barnsteen.The Baltic Lithuanian term for amber is gintaras and Latvian dzintars. They, and the Slavic jantar or Hungarian gyanta ('resin'), are thought to originate from Phoenician jainitar (\"sea-resin\").[citation needed].

In his early life, he served as private tutor to a young nobleman, whom he accompanied to Göttingen and then on a trip through northern Europe.[1] From 1799 he became a bookseller, writer, and editor.[2] From 1806 to 1816 he edited the journal Zeitung für die elegante Welt,[2] and from 1810 to 1818 the newspaper Leipziger Zeitung, the latter of which resulted in his brief imprisonment in 1813 by the French during the Napoleonic Wars, in the fortress of Erfurt.[1] Among his writings are a novel, Albano der Lautenspieler (1802), a parody of August von Kotzebue's Die Hussiten vor Naumburg (1803), and various short stories.[2] His poetry was quite popular in the 19th century, and was published in a collection in 1825,[2] and again posthumously in 8 volumes in 1839–40, and 3 volumes in 1859.[1] The poems \"Sehnsucht\" (1802) and \"Weinlied\" (1808) were his most popular.[2] In addition, he adapted the lyrics of \"God Save the King\" for the Kingdom of Saxony, as \"Gott segne Sachsenland\" (\"God Save Saxony\").[3] He later studied the natural sciences and economics, and was appointed director of the Leipzig Economic Society.[1]\n\n","path":[82200,8.581117,53.49825,80940,8.581117,53.49825,79620,8.581117,53.49825,78300,8.581117,53.49825,76980,8.581117,53.49825,75600,8.581117,53.49825,74220,8.581117,53.49825,72960,8.581117,53.49825,71580,8.581117,53.49825,70140,8.581117,53.49825,68880,8.581117,53.49825,67560,8.581117,53.49825,66240,8.581117,53.49825,64920,8.581117,53.49825,63660,8.581117,53.49825,62400,8.581117,53.49825,61140,8.581117,53.49825,59820,8.581117,53.49825,59700,8.58095,53.49873,59520,8.580822,53.50089,59340,8.581863,53.50621,59220,8.58124,53.51228,59040,8.577197,53.5172,58920,8.575011,53.52217,58740,8.57543,53.52723,58560,8.577907,53.5319,57360,8.57795,53.53219,57240,8.577993,53.53233,57060,8.578426,53.53374,56160,8.578465,53.53402,55920,8.57737,53.53505,55800,8.574542,53.53515,55620,8.571992,53.5311,55500,8.567043,53.52697,55380,8.559802,53.52372,55200,8.550299,53.51972,55020,8.541188,53.51607,54840,8.529202,53.51099,54720,8.521017,53.50733,54540,8.513913,53.50213,54420,8.507658,53.49655,54240,8.501438,53.48983,54060,8.497347,53.48307,53940,8.495758,53.47681]},{"name":"MEDITERRANEAN SEA","text":"MEDITERRANEAN SEA:The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced /ˌmɛdɪtəˈreɪniən ˈsiː/)[a] is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.The name Mediterranean is derived from the Latin mediterraneus, meaning \"inland\" or \"in the middle of land\" (from medius, \"middle\" and terra, \"land\"). It covers an approximate area of 2.5 million km2 (965,000 sq mi), but its connection to the Atlantic (the Strait of Gibraltar) is only 14 km (8.7 mi) wide. The Strait of Gibraltar is a narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Gibraltar and Spain in Europe from Morocco in Africa. In oceanography, it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea or the European Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere.[3][4]The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m (4,900 ft) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m (17,280 ft) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea. The sea is bordered on the north by Europe, the east by Asia, and in the south by Africa. It is located between latitudes 30° and 46° N and longitudes 6° W and 36° E. Its west-east length, from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun, on the southwestern coast of Turkey, is approximately 4,000 km (2,500 miles). The sea's average north-south length, from Croatia’s southern shore to Libya, is approximately 800 km (500 miles). The Mediterranean Sea, including the Sea of Marmara (connected by the Dardanelles to the Aegean Sea), has a surface area of approximately 2,510,000 square km (970,000 square miles).[5]The sea was an important route for merchants and travelers of ancient times that allowed for trade and cultural exchange between emergent peoples of the region. The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies.The countries with coastlines on the Mediterranean Sea are Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Monaco, Montenegro, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey. In addition, Palestine's Gaza Strip and the British Overseas Territories of Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia have coastlines on the sea.The term Mediterranean derives from the Latin word mediterraneus, meaning \"amid the earth (note: earth in the sense \"soil\", not Planet Earth)\" or \"between land\" (medi-; adj. medius, -um -a \"middle, between\" + terra f., \"land, earth\"): as it is between the continents of Africa, Asia and Europe. The Ancient Greek name Mesogeios (Μεσόγειος), is similarly from μέσο, \"between\" + γη, \"land, earth\").[6] It can be compared with the Ancient Greek name Mesopotamia (Μεσοποταμία), meaning \"between rivers\".The Mediterranean Sea has historically had several names. For example, the Carthaginians called it the \"Syrian Sea\" and latter Romans commonly called it Mare Nostrum (Latin, \"Our Sea\"), and occasionally Mare Internum (Sallust, The Jugurthine War 17).In ancient Syrian texts, Phoenician epics and in the Hebrew Bible, it was primarily known as the \"Great Sea\" (הַיָּם הַגָּדוֹל, HaYam HaGadol, Numbers 34:6,7; Joshua 1:4, 9:1, 15:47; Ezekiel 47:10,15,20), or simply \"The Sea\" (1 Kings 5:9; comp. 1 Macc. 14:34, 15:11); however, it has also been called the \"Hinder Sea\" (הַיָּם הָאַחֲרוֹן), due to its location on the west coast of Greater Syria or the Holy Land, and therefore behind a person facing the east, sometimes translated as \"Western Sea\", (Deut. 11:24; Joel 2:20). Another name was the \"Sea of the Philistines\" (יָם פְּלִשְׁתִּים, Exod. 23:31), from the people inhabiting a large portion of its shores near the Israelites. The sea is also called the \"Great Sea\" (Middle English: Grete See) in the General Prologue by Geoffrey Chaucer. In Ottoman Turkish, it has also been called Bahr-i Sefid, meaning the \"Pure White Sea\".In Modern Hebrew, it has been called HaYam HaTikhon (הַיָּם הַתִּיכוֹן), \"the Middle Sea\", reflecting the Sea's name in ancient Greek (Mesogeios), Latin (Mare internum), and modern languages in both Europe and the Middle East (Mediterranean, etc.).Similarly, in Modern Arabic, it is known as al-Baḥr [al-Abyaḍ] al-Mutawassiṭ (البحر [الأبيض] المتوسط), \"the [White] Middle Sea\", while in Islamic and older Arabic literature, it was referenced as Baḥr al-Rūm (بحر الروم), or \"the Romaic/Byzantine Sea.\"In Turkish, it is known as Akdeniz,[7] \"the White Sea\" since among Turks the white colour (ak) represents the west.Several ancient civilisations were located around the Mediterranean shores, and were greatly influenced by their proximity to the sea. It provided routes for trade, colonisation, and war, as well as food (from fishing and the gathering of other seafood) for numerous communities throughout the ages.[8]Due to the shared climate, geology, and access to the sea, cultures centered on the Mediterranean tended to have some extent of intertwined culture and history.Two of the most notable Mediterranean civilisations in classical antiquity were the Greek city states and the Phoenicians, both of which extensively colonised the coastlines of the Mediterranean. Later, when Augustus founded the Roman Empire, the Romans referred to the Mediterranean as Mare Nostrum (\"Our Sea\").Darius I of Persia, who conquered Ancient Egypt, built a canal linking the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. Darius's canal was wide enough for two triremes to pass each other with oars extended, and required four days to traverse.[9]The western Roman empire collapsed around AD 476. Temporarily the east was again dominant as the Byzantine Empire formed from the eastern half of the Roman empire. Another power arose in the 7th century, and with it the religion of Islam, which soon swept across from the east; at its greatest extent, the Arab Empire controlled 75% of the Mediterranean region and left a lasting footprint on its eastern and southern shores.Europe was reviving, however, as more organised and centralised states began to form in the later Middle Ages after the Renaissance of the 12th century.Ottoman power continued to grow, and in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was extinguished with the Conquest of Constantinople. Ottomans gained control of much of the sea in the 16th century and maintained naval bases in southern France, Algeria and Tunisia. Barbarossa, the famous Ottoman captain is a symbol of this domination with the victory of the Battle of Preveza. The Battle of Djerba marked the apex of Ottoman naval domination in the Mediterranean. As the naval prowess of the European powers increased, they confronted Ottoman expansion in the region when the Battle of Lepanto checked the power of the Ottoman Navy. This was the last naval battle to be fought primarily between galleys.The Barbary pirates of North Africa preyed on Christian shipping in the Western Mediterranean Sea.[10] According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th centuries, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves.[11]The development of oceanic shipping began to affect the entire Mediterranean. Once, all trade from the east had passed through the region, but now the circumnavigation of Africa allowed spices and other goods to be imported through the Atlantic ports of western Europe.[12][13][14]In 2013 the Maltese president described the Mediterranean sea as a \"cemetery\" due to the large amounts of migrants who drown there after their boats capsize.[15] European Parliament president Martin Schulz said that Europe's migration policy has \"turned the Mediterranean into a graveyard\", referring to the number of drowned refugees in the region as a direct result of the policies.[16] An Azerbaijani official described the sea as \"a burial ground ... where people die\".[17]Following the 2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck, the Italian government decided to strengthen the national system for the patrolling of the Mediterranean Sea by authorising \"Operation Mare Nostrum\", a military and humanitarian mission in order to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers of immigrants.[18]More than one million migrants crossed the Mediterranean sea into Europe in 2015.[19]The Mediterranean Sea is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar (known in Homer's writings as the \"Pillars of Hercules\") in the west and to the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea, by the Dardanelles and the Bosporus respectively, in the east. The Sea of Marmara is often considered a part of the Mediterranean Sea, whereas the Black Sea is generally not. The 163 km (101 mi) long artificial Suez Canal in the southeast connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea.Large islands in the Mediterranean include Cyprus, Crete, Euboea, Rhodes, Lesbos, Chios, Kefalonia, Corfu, Limnos, Samos, Naxos and Andros in the Eastern Mediterranean; Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, Cres, Krk, Brač, Hvar, Pag, Korčula and Malta in the central Mediterranean; and Ibiza, Majorca and Minorca (the Balearic Islands) in the Western Mediterranean.The typical Mediterranean climate has hot, humid, and dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Crops of the region include olives, grapes, oranges, tangerines, and cork.The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Mediterranean Sea as follows:[20]Stretching from the Strait of Gibraltar in the west to the entrances to the Dardanelles and the Suez Canal in the east, the Mediterranean Sea is bounded by the coasts of Europe, Africa and Asia, and is divided into two deep basins:(It should be noted that the coast referred to as belonging to Palestine in this document dating to 1953 has been within the internationally recognised borders of the country known as Israel since 1948. Of the territories administered by the Palestinian National Authority, only the Gaza Strip has a sea coast.)Being nearly landlocked affects conditions in the Mediterranean Sea: for instance, tides are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the Atlantic Ocean. The Mediterranean is characterised and immediately recognised by its deep blue colour.Evaporation greatly exceeds precipitation and river runoff in the Mediterranean, a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basin.[21] Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and salinity to increase eastward.[22] The salinity at 5 m depth is 3.8%.[23]The pressure gradient pushes relatively cool, low-salinity water from the Atlantic across the basin; it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east, then sinks in the region of the Levant and circulates westward, to spill over the Strait of Gibraltar.[24] Thus, seawater flow is eastward in the Strait's surface waters, and westward below; once in the Atlantic, this chemically distinct Mediterranean Intermediate Water can persist thousands of kilometres away from its source.[25]The following countries have a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea:Several other territories also border the Mediterranean Sea (from west to east): The British overseas territory of Gibraltar, the Spanish autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla and nearby islands, the Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus, and the State of Palestine's Gaza Strip.Major cities (municipalities) with populations larger than 200,000 people bordering the Mediterranean Sea are:According to the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), the Mediterranean Sea is subdivided into a number of smaller waterbodies, each with their own designation (from west to east):[20]Although not recognised by the IHO treaties, there are some other seas whose names have been in common use from the ancient times, or in the present:Many of these smaller seas feature in local myth and folklore and derive their names from these associations.In addition to the seas, a number of gulfs and straits are also recognised:The geologic history of the Mediterranean Sea is complex. Underlain by oceanic crust, the sea basin was once thought to be a tectonic remnant of the ancient Tethys Ocean; it is now known to be a structurally younger basin, called the Neotethys, which was first formed by the convergence of the African and Eurasian plates during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic. Because it is a near-landlocked body of water in a normally dry climate, the Mediterranean is subject to intensive evaporation and the precipitation of evaporites. The Messinian salinity crisis started about six million years ago (mya) when the Mediterranean became landlocked, and then essentially dried up. There are salt deposits accumulated on the bottom of the basin of more than a million cubic kilometres—in some places more than three kilometres thick.[41][42]Scientists estimate that the sea was last filled about 5.3 million years ago (mya) in less than two years by the Zanclean flood. Water poured in from the Atlantic Ocean through a newly breached gateway now called the Strait of Gibraltar at an estimated rate of about three orders of magnitude (one thousand times) larger than the current flow of the Amazon River.[43]The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m (4,900 ft) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m (17,280 ft) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea. The coastline extends for 46,000 km (29,000 mi). A shallow submarine ridge (the Strait of Sicily) between the island of Sicily and the coast of Tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions: the Western Mediterranean, with an area of about 850 thousand km2 (330 thousand mi2); and the Eastern Mediterranean, of about 1.65 million km2 (640 thousand mi2). A characteristic of the coastal Mediterranean are submarine karst springs or vruljas, which discharge pressurised groundwater into the coastal seawater from below the surface; the discharge water is usually fresh, and sometimes may be thermal.[44][45]The Mediterranean basin and sea system was established by the ancient African-Arabian continent colliding with the Eurasian continent. As Africa-Arabia drifted northward, it closed over the ancient Tethys Ocean which had earlier separated the two supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana. At about that time in the middle Jurassic period a much smaller sea basin, dubbed the Neotethys, was formed shortly before the Tethys Ocean closed at its western (Arabian) end. The broad line of collisions pushed up a very long system of mountains from the Pyrenees in Spain to the Zagros Mountains in Iran in an episode of mountain-building tectonics known as the Alpine orogeny. The Neotethys grew larger during the episodes of collisions (and associated foldings and subductions) that occurred during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs (34 to 5.33 mya); see animation: Africa-Arabia colliding with Eurasia. Accordingly, the Mediterranean basin consists of several stretched tectonic plates in subduction which are the foundation of the Eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. Various zones of subduction harbour and form the deepest and most majestic oceanic ridges, east of the Ionian Sea and south of the Aegean. The Central Indian Ridge runs East of the Mediterranean Sea South-East across the in-between of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula into the Indian Ocean. Nevertheless, while man-made geopolitical turmoil and chaos have governed the coastlines of many various Mediterranean nations throughout the courses of ancient, modern, present and foreseeable history, the Plate tectonic status of nations bordering the Mediterranean Sea will find sharing the same geological concerns and fate.During Mesozoic and Cenozoic times, as the northwest corner of Africa converged on Iberia, it lifted the Betic-Rif mountain belts across southern Iberia and northwest Africa. There the development of the intramontane Betic and Rif basins led to creating two roughly-parallel marine gateways between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Dubbed the Betic and Rifian corridors, they progressively closed during middle and late Miocene times; perhaps several times.[46] During late Miocene times the closure of the Betic Corridor triggered the so-called \"Messinian salinity crisis\" (MSC), when the Mediterranean almost entirely dried out. The time of beginning of the MSC was recently estimated astronomically at 5.96 mya, and it persisted for some 630,000 years until about 5.3 mya;[47] see Animation: Messinian salinity crisis, at right.After the initial drawdown and re-flooding there followed more episodes—the total number is debated—of sea drawdowns and re-floodings for the duration of the MSC. It ended when the Atlantic Ocean last re-flooded the basin—creating the Strait of Gibraltar and causing the Zanclean flood—at the end of the Miocene (5.33 mya). Some research has suggested that a desiccation-flooding-desiccation cycle may have repeated several times, which could explain several events of large amounts of salt deposition.[48][49] Recent studies, however, show that repeated desiccation and re-flooding is unlikely from a geodynamic point of view. [50][51]The present-day Atlantic gateway, i.e. the Strait of Gibraltar, originated in the early Pliocene via the Zanclean Flood. As mentioned, two other gateways preceded Gibraltar: the Betic Corridor across southern Spain and the Rifian Corridor across northern Morocco. The former gateway closed about six (6) mya, causing the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC); the latter or possibly both gateways closed during the earlier Tortonian times, causing a \"Tortonian salinity crisis\" (from 11.6 to 7.2 mya), which occurred well before the MSC and lasted much longer. Both \"crises\" resulted in broad connections of the mainlands of Africa and Europe, which thereby normalised migrations of flora and fauna—especially large mammals including primates—between the two continents. The Vallesian crisis indicates a typical extinction and replacement of mammal species in Europe during Tortonian times following climatic upheaval and overland migrations of new species;[52] see Animation: Messinian salinity crisis (and mammal migrations), at right.The near-completely enclosed configuration of the Mediterranean basin has enabled the oceanic gateways to dominate seawater circulation and the environmental evolution of the sea and basin. Circulation patterns are also affected by several other factors—including climate, bathymetry, and water chemistry and temperature—which are interactive and can induce precipitation of evaporites. Deposits of evaporites accumulated earlier in the nearby Carpathian foredeep during the Middle Miocene, and the adjacent Red Sea Basin (during the Late Miocene), and in the whole Mediterranean basin (during the MSC and the Messinian age). Diatomites are regularly found underneath the evaporite deposits, suggesting a connection between their geneses.Today, evaporation of surface seawater (output) is more than the supply (input) of fresh water by precipitation and coastal drainage systems, causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to be much higher than that of the Atlantic—so much so that the saltier Mediterranean waters sink below the waters incoming from the Atlantic, causing a two-layer flow across the Gibraltar strait: that is, an outflow submarine current of warm saline Mediterranean water, counterbalanced by an inflow surface current of less saline cold oceanic water from the Atlantic. Herman Sörgel's Atlantropa project proposal in the 1920s proposed a hydroelectric dam to be built across the Strait of Gibraltar, using the inflow current to provide a large amount of hydroelectric energy. The underlying energy grid was as well intended to support a political union between Europe and, at least, the Marghreb part of Africa (compare Eurafrika for the later impact and Desertec for a later project with some parallels in the planned grid).[53]The end of the Miocene also marked a change in the climate of the Mediterranean basin. Fossil evidence from that period reveals that the larger basin had a humid subtropical climate with rainfall in the summer supporting laurel forests. The shift to a \"Mediterranean climate\" occurred largely within the last three million years (the late Pliocene epoch) as summer rainfall decreased. The subtropical laurel forests retreated; and even as they persisted on the islands of Macaronesia off the Atlantic coast of Iberia and North Africa, the present Mediterranean vegetation evolved, dominated by coniferous trees and sclerophyllous trees and shrubs with small, hard, waxy leaves that prevent moisture loss in the dry summers. Much of these forests and shrublands have been altered beyond recognition by thousands of years of human habitation. There are now very few relatively intact natural areas in what was once a heavily wooded region.Because of its latitudinal position and its land-locked configuration, the Mediterranean is especially sensitive to astronomically induced climatic variations, which are well documented in its sedimentary record. Since the Mediterranean is involved in the deposition of eolian dust from the Sahara during dry periods, whereas riverine detrital input prevails during wet ones, the Mediterranean marine sapropel-bearing sequences provide high-resolution climatic information. These data have been employed in reconstructing astronomically calibrated time scales for the last 9 Ma of the Earth's history, helping to constrain the time of past geomagnetic reversals.[54] Furthermore, the exceptional accuracy of these paleoclimatic records has improved our knowledge of the Earth's orbital variations in the past.As a result of the drying of the sea during the Messinian salinity crisis,[55] the marine biota of the Mediterranean are derived primarily from the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.The Alboran Sea is a transition zone between the two seas, containing a mix of Mediterranean and Atlantic species. The Alboran Sea has the largest population of bottlenose dolphins in the Western Mediterranean, is home to the last population of harbour porpoises in the Mediterranean, and is the most important feeding grounds for loggerhead sea turtles in Europe. The Alboran sea also hosts important commercial fisheries, including sardines and swordfish. The Mediterranean monk seals live in the Aegean Sea in Greece. In 2003, the World Wildlife Fund raised concerns about the widespread drift net fishing endangering populations of dolphins, turtles, and other marine animals.For 4,000 years, human activity has transformed most parts of Mediterranean Europe, and the \"humanisation of the landscape\" overlapped with the appearance of the present Mediterranean climate.[56] The image of a simplistic, environmental determinist notion of a Mediterranean Paradise on Earth in antiquity, which was destroyed by later civilisations dates back to at least the 18th century and was for centuries fashionable in archaeological and historical circles. Based on a broad variety of methods, e.g. historical documents, analysis of trade relations, floodplain sediments, pollen, tree-ring and further archaeometric analyses and population studies, Alfred Thomas Grove and Oliver Rackham's work on \"The Nature of Mediterranean Europe\" challenges this common wisdom of a Mediterranean Europe as a \"Lost Eden\", a formerly fertile and forested region, that had been progressively degraded and desertified by human mismanagement.[56] The belief stems more from the failure of the recent landscape to measure up to the imaginary past of the classics as idealised by artists, poets and scientists of the early modern Enlightenment.[56]The historical evolution of climate, vegetation and landscape in southern Europe from prehistoric times to the present is much more complex and underwent various changes. For example, some of the deforestation had already taken place before the Roman age. While in the Roman age large enterprises as the Latifundiums took effective care of forests and agriculture, the largest depopulation effects came with the end of the empire. Some[who?] assume that the major deforestation took place in modern times — the later usage patterns were also quite different e.g. in southern and northern Italy. Also, the climate has usually been unstable and showing various ancient and modern \"Little Ice Ages\",[57] and plant cover accommodated to various extremes and became resilient with regard to various patterns of human activity.[56]Humanisation was therefore not the cause of climate change but followed it.[56] The wide ecological diversity typical of Mediterranean Europe is predominantly based on human behavior, as it is and has been closely related human usage patterns.[56] The diversity range was enhanced by the widespread exchange and interaction of the longstanding and highly diverse local agriculture, intense transport and trade relations, and the interaction with settlements, pasture and other land use. The greatest human-induced changes, however, came after World War II, respectively in line with the '1950s-syndrome'[58] as rural populations throughout the region abandoned traditional subsistence economies. Grove and Rackham suggest that the locals left the traditional agricultural patterns towards taking a role as scenery-setting agents for the then much more important (tourism) travelers. This resulted in more monotonous, large-scale formations.[56] Among further current important threats to Mediterranean landscapes are overdevelopment of coastal areas, abandonment of mountains and, as mentioned, the loss of variety via the reduction of traditional agricultural occupations.[56]The region has a variety of geological hazards which have closely interacted with human activity and land use patterns. Among others, in the eastern Mediterranean, the Thera eruption, dated to the 17th or 16th century BC, caused a large tsunami that some experts hypothesise devastated the Minoan civilisation on the nearby island of Crete, further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe that inspired the Atlantis legend.[59] Mount Vesuvius is the only active volcano on the European mainland, while others as Mount Etna and Stromboli are to be found on neighbouring islands. The region around Vesuvius including the Phlegraean Fields Caldera west of Naples are quite active[60] and constitute the most densely populated volcanic region in the world and eruptive event may occur within decades.[61]Vesuvius itself is regarded as quite dangerous due to a tendency towards explosive (Plinian) eruptions.[62] It is best known for its eruption in AD 79 that led to the burying and destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.The large experience of member states and regional authorities has led to exchange on the international level with cooperation of NGOs, states, regional and municipality authorities and private persons.[63] The Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy is a quite positive example of natural hazards leading to improved relations of traditional rivals in the region after earthquakes in İzmir and Athens 1999. The European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was set up to respond to major natural disasters and express European solidarity to disaster-stricken regions within all of Europe.[64] The largest amount of fund requests in the EU is being directed to forest fires, followed by floodings and earthquakes. Forest fires are, whether man made or natural, an often recurring and dangerous hazard in the Mediterranean region.[63] Also, tsunamis are an often underestimated hazard in the region. For example, the 1908 Messina earthquake and tsunami took more than 123,000 lives in Sicily and Calabria and is among the most deadly natural disasters in modern Europe.Unlike the vast multidirectional Ocean currents in open Oceans within their respective Oceanic zones; biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea is that of a stable one due to the subtle but strong locked nature of currents which affects favorably, even the smallest macroscopic type of Volcanic Life Form. The stable Marine ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea and sea temperature provides a nourishing environment for life in the deep sea to flourish while assuring a balanced Aquatic ecosystem excluded from any external deep oceanic factors.The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean and Red Sea. The Red Sea is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal serves as a tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The Bitter Lakes, which are hyper-saline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the Eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, Red Sea species invade the Mediterranean biota, and not vice versa; this phenomenon is known as the Lessepsian migration (after Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French engineer) or Erythrean invasion. The construction of the Aswan High Dam across the Nile River in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich silt from the Nile into the Eastern Mediterranean, making conditions there even more like the Red Sea and worsening the impact of the invasive species.Invasive species have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the Mediterranean ecology, endangering many local and endemic Mediterranean species. A first look at some groups of exotic species show that more than 70% of the non-indigenous decapods and about 63% of the exotic fishes occurring in the Mediterranean are of Indo Pacific origin,[65] introduced into the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. This makes the Canal as the first pathway of arrival of \"alien\" species into the Mediterranean. The impacts of some lessepsian species have proven to be considerable mainly in the Levantine basin of the Mediterranean, where they are replacing native species and becoming a \"familiar sight\".According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature definition, as well as Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Ramsar Convention terminologies, they are alien species, as they are non-native (non-indigenous) to the Mediterranean Sea, and they are outside their normal area of distribution which is the Indo-Pacific region. When these species succeed in establishing populations in the Mediterranean sea, compete with and begin to replace native species they are \"Alien Invasive Species\", as they are an agent of change and a threat to the native biodiversity. In the context of CBD, \"introduction\" refers to the movement by human agency, indirect or direct, of an alien species outside of its natural range (past or present). The Suez Canal, being an artificial (man made) canal, is a human agency. Lessepsian migrants are therefore \"introduced\" species (indirect, and unintentional). Whatever wording is chosen, they represent a threat to the native Mediterranean biodiversity, because they are non-indigenous to this sea. In recent years, the Egyptian government's announcement of its intentions to deepen and widen the canal have raised concerns from marine biologists, fearing that such an act will only worsen the invasion of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean, facilitating the crossing of the canal for yet additional species.[66]In recent decades, the arrival of exotic species from the tropical Atlantic has become a noticeable feature. Whether this reflects an expansion of the natural area of these species that now enter the Mediterranean through the Gibraltar strait, because of a warming trend of the water caused by global warming; or an extension of the maritime traffic; or is simply the result of a more intense scientific investigation, is still an open question. While not as intense as the \"lessepsian\" movement, the process may be scientific interest and may therefore warrant increased levels of monitoring.[citation needed]By 2100 the overall level of the Mediterranean could rise between 3 to 61 cm (1.2 to 24.0 in) as a result of the effects of climate change.[67] This could have adverse effects on populations across the Mediterranean:Coastal ecosystems also appear to be threatened by sea level rise, especially enclosed seas such as the Baltic, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. These seas have only small and primarily east-west movement corridors, which may restrict northward displacement of organisms in these areas.[70] Sea level rise for the next century (2100) could be between 30 cm (12 in) and 100 cm (39 in) and temperature shifts of a mere 0.05-0.1 °C in the deep sea are sufficient to induce significant changes in species richness and functional diversity.[71]Pollution in this region has been extremely high in recent years.[when?] The United Nations Environment Programme has estimated that 650,000,000 t (720,000,000 short tons) of sewage, 129,000 t (142,000 short tons) of mineral oil, 60,000 t (66,000 short tons) of mercury, 3,800 t (4,200 short tons) of lead and 36,000 t (40,000 short tons) of phosphates are dumped into the Mediterranean each year.[72] The Barcelona Convention aims to 'reduce pollution in the Mediterranean Sea and protect and improve the marine environment in the area, thereby contributing to its sustainable development.'[73] Many marine species have been almost wiped out because of the sea's pollution. One of them is the Mediterranean monk seal which is considered to be among the world's most endangered marine mammals.[74]The Mediterranean is also plagued by marine debris. A 1994 study of the seabed using trawl nets around the coasts of Spain, France and Italy reported a particularly high mean concentration of debris; an average of 1,935 items per km2. Plastic debris accounted for 76%, of which 94% was plastic bags.[75]Some of the world's busiest shipping routes are in the Mediterranean Sea. It is estimated that approximately 220,000 merchant vessels of more than 100 tonnes cross the Mediterranean Sea each year—about one third of the world's total merchant shipping. These ships often carry hazardous cargo, which if lost would result in severe damage to the marine environment.The discharge of chemical tank washings and oily wastes also represent a significant source of marine pollution. The Mediterranean Sea constitutes 0.7% of the global water surface and yet receives 17% of global marine oil pollution. It is estimated that every year between 100,000 t (98,000 long tons) and 150,000 t (150,000 long tons) of crude oil are deliberately released into the sea from shipping activities.Approximately 370,000,000 t (360,000,000 long tons) of oil are transported annually in the Mediterranean Sea (more than 20% of the world total), with around 250-300 oil tankers crossing the sea every day. Accidental oil spills happen frequently with an average of 10 spills per year. A major oil spill could occur at any time in any part of the Mediterranean.[71]The Mediterranean Sea is arguably among the safest and most culturally diverse block basin sea regions in the world, renowned formostly for the Majestic Azure colour. With a unique combination of pleasant climate, beautiful coastline, rich history and various cultures the Mediterranean region is the most popular tourist destination in the world—attracting approximately one third of the world's international tourists.Tourism is one of the most important sources of income for many Mediterranean countries regardless of the man-made geopolitical conflicts that harbour coastal nations. In that regard, authorities around the Mediterranean have made it a point to extinguish rising man-made chaotic zones that would affect the economies, societies in neighboring coastal countries, let alone shipping routes. Naval and rescue components in the Mediterranean Sea are considered one of the very best due to the quick intercooperation of various Naval Fleets within proximity of each other. Unlike the vast open Oceans, the closed nature of the Mediterranean Sea provides a much more adaptable naval initiative among the coastal countries to provide effective naval and rescue missions, considered the safest and regardless of any man-made or natural disaster.Tourism also supports small communities in coastal areas and islands by providing alternative sources of income far from urban centers. However, tourism has also played major role in the degradation of the coastal and marine environment. Rapid development has been encouraged by Mediterranean governments to support the large numbers of tourists visiting the region each year. But this has caused serious disturbance to marine habitats such as erosion and pollution in many places along the Mediterranean coasts.Tourism often concentrates in areas of high natural wealth, causing a serious threat to the habitats of endangered Mediterranean species such as sea turtles and monk seals. Reductions in natural wealth may reduce incentives for tourists to visit.[71]Fish stock levels in the Mediterranean Sea are alarmingly low. The European Environment Agency says that more than 65% of all fish stocks in the region are outside safe biological limits and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, that some of the most important fisheries—such as albacore and bluefin tuna, hake, marlin, swordfish, red mullet and sea bream—are threatened.[date missing]There are clear indications that catch size and quality have declined, often dramatically, and in many areas larger and longer-lived species have disappeared entirely from commercial catches.Large open water fish like tuna have been a shared fisheries resource for thousands of years but the stocks are now dangerously low. In 1999, Greenpeace published a report revealing that the amount of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean had decreased by over 80% in the previous 20 years and government scientists warn that without immediate action the stock will collapse.Aquaculture is expanding rapidly—often without proper environmental assessment—and currently accounts for 30% of the fish protein consumed worldwide. The industry claims that farmed seafood lessens the pressure on wild fish stocks, yet many of the farmed species are carnivorous, consuming up to five times their weight in wild fish.Mediterranean coastal areas are already over exposed to human influence, with pristine areas becoming ever scarcer. The aquaculture sector adds to this pressure, requiring areas of high water quality to set up farms. The installation of fish farms close to vulnerable and important habitats such as seagrass meadows is particularly concerning.Beach of Hammamet, TunisiaThe beach of la Courtade in the Îles d'Hyères,

Bolm, George BalanchineApollo (originally Apollon musagète and variously known as Apollo musagetes, Apolo Musageta, and Apollo, Leader of the Muses) is a ballet in two tableaux composed between 1927 and 1928 by Igor Stravinsky. It was choreographed in 1928 by twenty-four-year-old George Balanchine, with the composer contributing the libretto. The scenery and costumes were designed by André Bauchant, with new costumes by Coco Chanel in 1929. The scenery was executed by Alexander Shervashidze, with costumes under the direction of Mme. A. Youkine. The American patron of the arts Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge had commissioned the ballet in 1927 for a festival of contemporary music to be held the following year at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.The story centres on Apollo, the Greek god of music, who is visited by three Muses: Terpsichore, muse of dance and song; Polyhymnia, muse of mime; and Calliope, muse of poetry. The ballet takes Classical antiquity as its subject, though its plot suggests a contemporary situation. It is concerned with the reinvention of tradition, since its inspiration is \"classique\" or even post-baroque. It uses a chamber orchestra with 34 string instruments (8.8.6.8.4).Stravinsky began composing Apollo on 16 July 1927 and completed the score on 9 January 1928. He composed for a refined instrumental force, a string orchestra of 34 instrumentalists: 8 first violins, 8 second violins, 6 violas, 4 first cellos, 4 second cellos and 4 double basses. The commission from the Library of Congress and underwritten by Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge paid him $1,000 for the piece, which was required to use only six dancers, require a small orchestra, and last no more than half an hour, but allowed him free choice of subject. Stravinsky had been thinking of writing a ballet on an episode in Greek mythology for some time and decided to make Apollo, leader of the muses, its central figure while reducing the number of muses from nine to three. They were Terpsichore, personifying the rhythm of poetry and the eloquence of gesture as embodied in the dance, Calliope, combining poetry and rhythm, Polyhymnia, representing mime. Stravinsky explained the original title Apollon Musagète to mean \"Apollo, Leader of the Muses\".Stravinsky wrote for a homogeneous ensemble of bowed string instruments, substituting contrasts in dynamics for the contrasts in timbre he employed in Pulcinella. The ballet takes its inspiration from the grand tradition of French 17th- and 18th-century music, in particular that of Lully, a source Stravinsky returned when composing Agon in 1957. The prologue begins with dotted rhythms in the style of a French overture. The work relies on a basic rhythmic cell, presented at the beginning of the work, which Stravinsky transforms by subdivisions of successive values that become increasingly complex. Stravinsky revised the score slightly in 1947. In 1963, he indicated he intended to make further changes, particularly with respect to double-dotting many of the dotted-rhythm passages in Baroque style.[1]The first ballet version of Stravinsky's Apollon musagète, commissioned especially for the Washington festival, premiered on 27 April 1928 with choreography by Adolph Bolm, who also danced the role of Apollo. Adolph Bolm put together a company of dancers for the premiere in a country which, at that time, lacked a readily available source of classically trained dancers. Ruth Page, Berenice Holmes (Gene Kelly's ballet teacher), and Elise Reiman were the three Muses and Hans Kindler conducted. Stravinsky took no interest in the U.S. performance, and Bolm's choreography is now practically forgotten.He had reserved the European rights to the score for Sergei Diaghilev, whose Ballets Russes production, choreographed by the 24-year-old Balanchine, opened at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt in Paris on 12 June 1928. Stravinsky conducted the performance. The concertmaster was Marcel Darrieux.In accordance with Stravinsky's wishes, the style of dancing was essentially classical, and Stravinsky thought of \"Apollon musagète\" as a ballet blanc, that is, costumed in traditional minimal white. Balanchine later said that when he heard Stravinsky's music all he could see was pristine white.[2] The clarity, calm, even serenity of the music makes it seem infinitely remote from the colorful excitement of Stravinsky's earlier ballets. The avoidance of any conflict in the scenario, of any narrative, psychological or expressive intent, was further matched by monochrome costumes for the dancers and the absence of elaborate scenery on stage.[3]Scenery and costumes for Balanchine's production were by French artist André Bauchant. Coco Chanel provided new costumes in 1929. Apollo wore a reworked toga with a diagonal cut, a belt, and laced up. The Muses wore a traditional tutus. The decoration was baroque: two large sets, with some rocks and Apollo's chariot. In the dance a certain academicism resurfaced in the stretching out and upward leaping of the body, but the Balanchine bent the angles of the arms and hands to define instead the genre of neoclassical ballet.The scenario involved the birth of Apollo, his interactions with the three Muses, Calliope (poetry), Polyhymnia (mime) and Terpsichore (dance & song), and his ascent as a god to Mount Parnassus. The original cast included Serge Lifar as Apollo, Alice Nikitina as Terpsichore (alternating with Alexandra Danilova), Lubov Tchernicheva as Calliope, Felia Doubrovska as Polyhymnia and Sophie Orlova as Leto, mother of Apollo.[4]For a revival with Mikhail Baryshnikov as Apollo in 1979, he also omitted Apollo's first variation and re-choreographed the ballet's ending. This revision concluded not with Apollo's ascent to Mount Parnassus but rather with a repetition of the earlier tableau of the Muses posing in ascending arabesques beside Apollo. In the 1980 staging for the New York City Ballet, Apollo's first variation was restored. Suzanne Farrell restored the birth scene for her company in 2001, as did Arthur Mitchell for his Dance Theatre of Harlem performance at Symphony Space's Wall to Wall Balanchine in conjunction with City Ballet's Balanchine centennial and Iain Webb for The Sarasota Ballet's Tribute to Nureyev performance in February 2015 (staged by Sandra Jennings).The characters are Apollo and three muses: Calliope, the muse of poetry; Polyhymnia, the muse of rhetoric; and Terpsichore, the muse of dance. The theme is: Apollon musagetes instructs the muses in their arts and leads them to Parnassus. The ballet is divided into two tableaux:Balanchine shortened the title to Apollo in the 1950s, which Stravinsky himself came to prefer. Despite the popularly considered Balanchine-Stravinsky Greek link due to Balanchine's later work with Stravinsky scores in Orpheus and Agon, the music for Apollo was commissioned by the Library of Congress. Orpheus may be considered a sequel to Apollo but Agon is a formal plotless ballet whose title in Greek evokes a contest.","path":[59340,8.535742,53.56822,59160,8.541255,53.56239,59040,8.545825,53.55707,58800,8.552482,53.54956,58680,8.555997,53.54596,58500,8.560213,53.54089,58320,8.561463,53.53773,58200,8.56279,53.53592,57960,8.561895,53.53708,57720,8.560668,53.5397,57600,8.559512,53.54124,57420,8.558145,53.54343,57240,8.55666,53.54461,57060,8.554755,53.54635,56880,8.552747,53.54848,56700,8.551008,53.54966,56580,8.549625,53.55101,56400,8.547724,53.55252,56280,8.546494,53.55359,56160,8.54581,53.55553,56040,8.543925,53.55662,55920,8.542657,53.55778,55740,8.541007,53.55911,55620,8.539762,53.56018,55500,8.53829,53.56164,55320,8.537642,53.56314,55020,8.535577,53.56571,54900,8.534721,53.5666,54600,8.532224,53.56953,54420,8.530465,53.57073,53940,8.526217,53.57479,53820,8.52796,53.57592,53700,8.525723,53.57624,53460,8.525249,53.57572,53280,8.526009,53.57605,50340,8.490905,53.61799,49800,8.485125,53.62112,49260,8.480757,53.62441,49080,8.477928,53.62638,48840,8.476575,53.62711,48660,8.478191,53.62498,48300,8.492395,53.61184,48060,8.501224,53.60251,47940,8.506023,53.59698,47760,8.507354,53.59353,47580,8.505935,53.59414,47460,8.504989,53.59486,47280,8.503322,53.59646,47160,8.502287,53.59751,46980,8.500359,53.59896,46800,8.498415,53.60048,46680,8.497175,53.6012,46500,8.496128,53.60146,46380,8.4949,53.60246,46260,8.493935,53.60328,46080,8.492925,53.60404,45960,8.491714,53.6049,45780,8.490612,53.60578,45480,8.488417,53.60818,45180,8.484595,53.61042,45060,8.482725,53.6114,44880,8.476345,53.61497,44640,8.471064,53.62065,44400,8.471865,53.62611,44280,8.471916,53.63135,43440,8.449986,53.65065,42720,8.436269,53.65958,42420,8.439921,53.65803,42120,8.44483,53.65529,41760,8.451756,53.65212,40440,8.46853,53.63747,40020,8.472076,53.63228,39780,8.473224,53.63022,38220,8.4322,53.66172,37620,8.441665,53.65686,37440,8.445057,53.6554,37200,8.449424,53.65351,35400,8.470275,53.63586,34860,8.472283,53.62792,34680,8.47951,53.62103,34500,8.48415,53.61453,34380,8.483775,53.61128,34200,8.485398,53.60975,33840,8.490606,53.60635,33600,8.494773,53.60395,33480,8.49719,53.6028,33240,8.50053,53.60086,33060,8.502305,53.59906,32820,8.505197,53.59622,32580,8.507832,53.59369,32400,8.509787,53.59202,32280,8.511177,53.59066,32160,8.512201,53.58931,31980,8.510592,53.58953,31860,8.509187,53.59089,31680,8.507705,53.59231,31560,8.506545,53.59347,31260,8.504157,53.59609,31140,8.502575,53.59709,30900,8.504033,53.59491,30720,8.506333,53.5929,30600,8.507921,53.59175,30300,8.511395,53.58958,30060,8.510721,53.59158,29940,8.509356,53.59291,29760,8.508188,53.59408,29520,8.506097,53.59648,29400,8.504492,53.59792,29280,8.502831,53.5987,29160,8.501213,53.59955,29040,8.499434,53.6005,28920,8.497909,53.59988,28680,8.499833,53.59816,28440,8.502215,53.59563,28200,8.504797,53.59342,27960,8.507627,53.5914,27840,8.509296,53.59027,27660,8.511204,53.58958,27420,8.511052,53.59177,27180,8.509229,53.59457,26940,8.505812,53.5977,26820,8.50415,53.59883,26520,8.500029,53.60126,26400,8.498005,53.60263,26280,8.495399,53.60373,26160,8.49334,53.6047,25980,8.490787,53.60612,25860,8.48888,53.6075,25500,8.48439,53.61059,25380,8.481544,53.61207,25200,8.47572,53.61752,25020,8.471922,53.62549,24840,8.47032,53.63215,24720,8.470861,53.63688,24540,8.47598,53.63981,24420,8.481283,53.64226,24180,8.485487,53.64507,24060,8.488577,53.64639,23940,8.491805,53.647]},{"name":"HELUAN","text":"HELUAN:did you mean Helena? Princess Helena (Helena Augusta Victoria; Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein by marriage;[1] 25 May 1846 – 9 June 1923) was the third daughter and fifth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.Helena was educated by private tutors chosen by her father and his close friend and adviser, Baron Stockmar. Her childhood was spent with her parents, travelling between the variety of royal residences in Britain. The intimate atmosphere of the royal court came to an end on 14 December 1861, when her father died and her mother entered a period of intense mourning. In the early 1860s, Helena began a flirtation with Prince Albert's German librarian, Carl Ruland. Although the nature of the relationship is largely unknown, Helena's romantic letters to Ruland survive.[2] After the Queen found out in 1863, she dismissed Ruland, who returned to his native Germany. Three years later, on 5 July 1866, Helena married the impoverished German Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. The couple remained in Britain, in calling distance of the Queen, who liked to have her daughters nearby, and Helena along with her youngest sister, Princess Beatrice, became the Queen's unofficial secretary. However, after Queen Victoria's death on 22 January 1901, Helena saw relatively little of her surviving siblings.Helena was the most active member of the royal family, carrying out an extensive programme of royal engagements at a time when royalty was not expected to appear often in public. She was also an active patron of charities, and was one of the founding members of the Red Cross. She was founding president of the Royal School of Needlework, and president of the Royal British Nurses' Association. As president of the latter, she was a strong supporter of nurse registration against the advice of Florence Nightingale.[3] She became the first member of her family to celebrate her 50th wedding anniversary in 1916, but her husband died a year later. Helena outlived him by six years, and died aged 77 at Schomberg House on 9 June 1923.","path":[81540,8.53994,53.57358,80100,8.54002,53.57352,78840,8.540063,53.57351,77220,8.540024,53.57349,75960,8.540035,53.57347,74700,8.539989,53.57357,73440,8.540043,53.57348,72180,8.539993,53.57346,70740,8.540017,53.57349,69300,8.54002,53.57347,68040,8.540022,53.57345,65340,8.54001,53.5735,63900,8.539967,53.57351,62460,8.540027,53.57346,61020,8.540025,53.5735,59220,8.540022,53.57349,57780,8.539957,53.57344,56340,8.540025,53.5735,55080,8.538888,53.57299,54840,8.538715,53.57214,54720,8.53916,53.57123,54420,8.537807,53.57306,54300,8.536159,53.57411,54120,8.531692,53.5773,54000,8.526208,53.58143,53880,8.520304,53.58655,53700,8.51511,53.59152,53520,8.509017,53.59731,53400,8.505538,53.60013,53280,8.499666,53.60483,53100,8.490441,53.6117,52980,8.477233,53.61843,52740,8.45639,53.62766,52560,8.439475,53.63427,52380,8.423797,53.64089,52200,8.405878,53.64852,52080,8.395139,53.65508,51840,8.380012,53.66589,51720,8.368918,53.67387,51120,8.318505,53.70473,50940,8.303654,53.71021,50820,8.287263,53.71609,50640,8.270817,53.72232,50520,8.25695,53.7275,50220,8.228902,53.73751,50100,8.216705,53.74302,49980,8.205022,53.75003,49800,8.192135,53.75809,49620,8.17936,53.76545,49440,8.166348,53.7756,49080,8.136127,53.79811,48840,8.120718,53.80991,48720,8.110338,53.81763,48540,8.099717,53.82456,48420,8.08462,53.82969,48300,8.071155,53.83375,48120,8.056595,53.83848,47940,8.03789,53.84382,47820,8.023055,53.84819,47640,8.004312,53.85063,46920,7.922787,53.85921,46800,7.906527,53.86151,46500,7.872815,53.86735,46320,7.858366,53.86946,46200,7.845623,53.87074,45960,7.83582,53.87259,45840,7.828207,53.87374,45720,7.820034,53.87438,45300,7.781495,53.87813,45180,7.766613,53.87995,44640,7.70452,53.88534,44460,7.683997,53.88711,43560,7.569633,53.89635,43440,7.55634,53.89715,43260,7.536782,53.89735,43080,7.515165,53.89524,42900,7.489065,53.89195,42780,7.470499,53.88963,42600,7.452303,53.88742,42480,7.433969,53.88508,42300,7.410988,53.88224,42120,7.386475,53.87962,41940,7.36726,53.87783,41820,7.34742,53.87603,41700,7.335323,53.87488,41520,7.312366,53.87269,41340,7.293312,53.87088,41220,7.273277,53.86902,41040,7.254163,53.86697,40920,7.233493,53.86453,40740,7.211645,53.86184,40560,7.192147,53.85925,40440,7.174012,53.85693,40320,7.157435,53.85487,40140,7.13943,53.8526,40020,7.121495,53.8501,39840,7.102129,53.84711,39720,7.083915,53.84404,39540,7.06635,53.84074,39420,7.047713,53.83729,39300,7.032308,53.8344,39060,7.007535,53.83006,38940,6.991628,53.82754,38820,6.976083,53.82515,38700,6.95929,53.82259,38460,6.934452,53.81877,38340,6.917732,53.81627,38220,6.901755,53.81393,38040,6.884218,53.81147,37920,6.867425,53.80905,37800,6.849741,53.80656,37560,6.82499,53.80291,37440,6.808687,53.80061,37320,6.792318,53.79823,37080,6.767135,53.7947,36960,6.750323,53.79241,36840,6.734143,53.79009,36600,6.710495,53.78675,36480,6.69431,53.78465,36360,6.677957,53.7825,36180,6.66093,53.7802,36060,6.644485,53.77808,35940,6.62856,53.77605,35760,6.608459,53.77341,35640,6.5925,53.77137,35460,6.572368,53.76867,35340,6.556052,53.76646,32760,6.25497,53.71776,32580,6.231047,53.71305,32460,6.218502,53.71069,32340,6.202842,53.70767,31980,6.164082,53.70023,31860,6.144965,53.69646,31560,6.110328,53.68983,31380,6.093383,53.68649,31260,6.07502,53.68294,31140,6.06066,53.6802,31020,6.04628,53.67744,30900,6.030777,53.67443,30720,6.01155,53.67071,30600,5.995853,53.66767,30420,5.978394,53.6643,30180,5.948625,53.65858,30060,5.932278,53.65533,29940,5.918193,53.65262,29760,5.899607,53.64895,29580,5.879818,53.64496,29400,5.856485,53.64051,29220,5.83499,53.63633,29100,5.820045,53.63345,28980,5.805772,53.63065,28860,5.789357,53.62746,28740,5.774443,53.62417,28620,5.760628,53.62104,28440,5.74225,53.61703,28320,5.728105,53.61393,28200,5.713927,53.61087,28080,5.69936,53.60765,27960,5.685235,53.60491,27840,5.668905,53.60175,27720,5.654673,53.599,27480,5.631793,53.59508,27300,5.610022,53.59146,27120,5.588287,53.58798,26880,5.55715,53.58301,26760,5.541992,53.58062,26640,5.52715,53.57799,26520,5.512755,53.57561,26400,5.49831,53.57307,26280,5.480987,53.56983,26100,5.46356,53.56657,25980,5.447453,53.56362,25860,5.43272,53.56096,25740,5.418128,53.5583,25620,5.403678,53.55558,25500,5.389349,53.55278,25380,5.374933,53.5499,25260,5.360335,53.54719,25140,5.344982,53.54419,24960,5.328365,53.54094,24780,5.305863,53.53649,24600,5.283875,53.53215,24420,5.262265,53.52763,24240,5.240638,53.52319,24060,5.2189,53.51881,23880,5.197108,53.51479,23700,5.175378,53.51079,23520,5.151333,53.50645,23400,5.136432,53.50369,23280,5.118832,53.50053,23040,5.094057,53.49565,22920,5.07754,53.49191,22800,5.061769,53.4883,22620,5.045243,53.48466,22440,5.020563,53.47905,22320,5.003088,53.47521,22140,4.98523,53.47121,22020,4.96805,53.46714,21780,4.943892,53.46169,21660,4.926613,53.45762,21540,4.910018,53.45385,21360,4.890471,53.44941,21180,4.872615,53.44527,21060,4.85427,53.44063,20940,4.83867,53.43664,20760,4.822237,53.43242,20640,4.80381,53.4278,20400,4.77797,53.42102,20280,4.76066,53.41641,20100,4.742599,53.41154,19980,4.726903

Åland Islands or Åland (Swedish: Åland, IPA: [ˈoːland]; Finnish: Ahvenanmaa) is a region of Finland that consists of an archipelago at the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia in the Baltic Sea. It is autonomous, demilitarised and is the only monolingually Swedish-speaking region in Finland. Collectively, the islands in the archipelago form the smallest region of Finland, constituting 0.49% of its land area and 0.50% of its population.Åland comprises Fasta Åland on which 90% of the population resides[6] and a further 6,500 skerries and islands to its east. Fasta Åland is separated from the coast of Sweden by 38 kilometres (24 mi) of open water to the west. In the east, the Åland archipelago is contiguous with the Finnish Archipelago Sea. Åland's only land border is located on the uninhabited skerry of Märket,[7] which it shares with Sweden.Åland's autonomous status means that those provincial powers normally exercised by representatives of the central Finnish government are largely exercised by its own government.The autonomous status of the islands was affirmed by a decision made by the League of Nations in 1921 following the Åland crisis. It was reaffirmed within the treaty admitting Finland to the European Union. By law, Åland is politically neutral and entirely demilitarised, and residents are exempt from conscription to the Finnish Defence Forces. The islands were granted extensive autonomy by the Parliament of Finland in the Act on the Autonomy of Åland of 1920, which was later replaced by new legislation by the same name in 1951 and 1991.[8] Åland remains exclusively Swedish-speaking by law.In connection with Finland's admission to the European Union, a protocol was signed concerning the Åland Islands that stipulates, among other things, that provisions of the European Community Treaty shall not force a change of the existing restrictions for foreigners (i.e., persons who do not enjoy \"home region rights\" (hembygdsrätt) in Åland) to acquire and hold real property or to provide certain services.Åland's original name was in the Proto-Norse language *Ahvaland which means \"Land of Water\". In Swedish, this first developed into Áland and eventually into Åland, literally \"river land\"—even though rivers are not a prominent feature of Åland's geography. The Finnish and Estonian names of the island, Ahvenanmaa and Ahvenamaa (\"perch land\"), are seen to preserve another form of the old name.[9]Another theory suggests that the Finnish Ahvenanmaa would be the original name of the archipelago, from which the Swedish Åland derives.[10]The official name, Landskapet Åland, means \"the Region of Åland\"; landskap is cognate to English \"landscape\".Members of the Neolithic Comb Ceramic culture started settling the islands some 7000 years ago, after the islands had began to re-emerge from the sea after being pushed down by the weight of the continental ice of the latest ice age. Two neolithic cultures met on Åland: Comb Ceramic culture and later Pit-Comb Ware culture which spread from the west.[11]Stone Age and Bronze Age people found food by hunting seals and birds, fishing, and gathering plants. They also started early agriculture. In the Iron Age contacts to Scandinavia were increasing. From the Viking age there are over 380 documented burial sites and six castle ruins.[11]In the 1200s, Åland and Finland were incorporated into the Swedish Empire.[11] The Åland Islands formed part of the territory ceded to Russia by Sweden under the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in September 1809. As a result, along with all other parts of Finland, they became part of the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland.During this process, Sweden failed to secure a provision that the islands not be fortified. The issue was important not only for Sweden but also for the United Kingdom, which was concerned that a military presence on the islands could threaten Britain's military and commercial interests.In 1832, Russia started to fortify the islands with the great fortress of Bomarsund. A combined British and French force of warships and marines captured and destroyed the fortress in 1854 as part of the campaign in the Baltic during the Crimean War. The 1856 Treaty of Paris demilitarized the entire Åland archipelago.During the Finnish Civil War, in 1918, Swedish troops intervened as a peacekeeping force between the Russian troops stationed on the islands and \"White\" and \"Red\" Finnish troops who came from Finland over the frozen sea. (Historians[who?] point out that Sweden may have in reality planned to occupy the islands.) Within weeks, the Swedish troops gave way to German troops who occupied Åland by request of the \"White\" (conservative) Senate of Finland.After 1917 the residents of the islands worked towards having them ceded to Sweden. In 1919 a petition for secession from Finland and integration with Sweden was signed by 96.4% of the voters on the islands, with over 95% in favour.[12] Swedish nationalist sentiments had grown strong particularly as a result of the anti-Swedish tendencies in Finland and Finnish nationalism fueled by Finland's struggle to retain its autonomy and resistance against Russification. The conflict between the Swedish-speaking minority and the Finnish-speaking majority on the mainland, prominent in Finnish politics since the 1840s, contributed to the apprehension of the Åland population about its future in Finland.Finland, however, declined to cede the islands and instead offered them an autonomous status. Nevertheless, the residents did not approve the offer, and the dispute over the islands was submitted to the League of Nations. The latter decided that Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the Åland Islands should be made an autonomous territory. Thus Finland was obliged to ensure the residents of the Åland Islands the right to maintain the Swedish language, as well as their own culture and local traditions. At the same time, an international treaty established the neutral status of Åland, prohibiting the placing of military installations or forces on the islands.The combination of disappointment about insufficient support from Sweden in the League of Nations, Swedish disrespect for Åland's demilitarized status in the 1930s, and some feelings of a shared destiny with Finland during and after World War II has changed the islanders' perception of Åland's relation to Finland from \"a Swedish province in Finnish possession\" to \"an autonomous part of Finland\".[citation needed] The islanders enjoyed safety at sea during World War II, as their merchant fleet sailed for both the Allied countries and Germany. Consequently, Åland shipping was not generally attacked as each side rarely knew which cargo was being carried to whom.Finland marked the 150th anniversary of demilitarisation of the Åland Islands by issuing a high-value commemorative coin, the €5 150th Anniversary of Demilitarisation of Åland Islands commemorative coin, minted in 2006. The obverse depicts a pine tree, very typical in the Åland Islands. The reverse design features a boat's stern and rudder, with a dove perched on the tiller, a symbol of 150 years of peace.The Åland Islands are governed according to the Act on the Autonomy of Åland and international treaties. These laws guarantee the islands' autonomy from Finland, which has ultimate sovereignty over them, as well as a demilitarized status. The Government of Åland, or Landskapsregering, answers to the Parliament of Åland, or Lagting, in accordance with the principles of parliamentarism.Åland has its own flag, has issued its own postage stamps since 1984, runs its own police force, and is a member of the Nordic Council. Since 2005 the Åland Islands also have had their own airline, Air Åland. The islands are demilitarised, and the population is exempt from conscription. Although Åland's autonomy preceded the creation of the regions of Finland, the autonomous government of Åland also has responsibility for the functions undertaken by Finland's regional councils. Åland is a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation. The islands are considered a separate \"entity\" for amateur radio purposes and have their own callsign prefix granted by Finland, OHØ.The Åland Islands are guaranteed representation in the Finnish parliament, to which they elect one representative. Åland also has a different system of political parties from the mainland (see List of political parties in Finland).Homeschooling, which was effectively banned in Sweden in 2011, is allowed by the Finnish government. Due to the islands' proximity to Sweden and because the islands are Swedish speaking, a number of Swedish homeschooling families have moved from the Swedish mainland to Åland, including Jonas Himmelstrand, the chairman of the Swedish association for homeschooling.[13]The State Department of Åland represents the Finnish central government and performs many administrative duties. It has a somewhat different function from the other Regional Administrative Agencies, owing to its autonomy. Prior to 2010, the state administration was handled by the Åland State Provincial Office.Åland has its own postal administration but still uses the Finnish five-digit postal code system, using the number range 22000-22999, with the prefix AX. The lowest numbered postal code is for the capital Mariehamn, AX 22100, and the highest AX 22950 for Jurmo.The Åland Islands occupy a position of strategic importance, as they command one of the entrances to the port of Stockholm, as well as the approaches to the Gulf of Bothnia, in addition to being situated near the Gulf of Finland.The Åland archipelago consists of nearly three hundred habitable islands, of which about eighty are inhabited; the remainder are merely some 6,000 skerries and desolate rocks. The archipelago is connected to Åboland archipelago in the east (Finnish: Turunmaan saaristo, Swedish: Åbolands skärgård)—the archipelago adjacent to the southwest coast of Finland. Together they form the Archipelago Sea. To West from Åland is Sea of Åland and to North the Bothnian Sea.The surface of the islands is generally rocky and the soil thin. There are several harbours.The islands' landmass occupies a total area of 1,527 square kilometres (590 sq mi). Ninety percent of the population live on Fasta Åland, which is also the site of the capital town of Mariehamn. Fasta Åland is the largest island in the archipelago, extending over 1,010 km2 (390 sq mi), more than 66% of the province's land area. It measures approximately 47 kilometres (29 mi) from north to south and 34 kilometres (21 mi) from east to west.During the Åland crisis, the parties sought support from different maps of the islands. On the Swedish map, the most densely populated main island dominated, and many skerries were left out. On the Finnish map, many smaller islands or skerries were, for technical reasons, given a slightly exaggerated size. The Swedish map made the islands appear to be closer to the mainland of Sweden than to Finland; the Finnish map stressed the continuity of the archipelago between the main island and mainland Finland, while a greater gap appeared between the islands and the archipelago on the Swedish side. One consequence is the oft-repeated number of \"over 6,000\" skerries that was given authority by the outcome of the arbitration.Åland's economy is heavily dominated by shipping, trade and tourism. Shipping represents about 40% of the economy, with several international carriers owned and operated off Åland. Most companies aside from shipping are small, with fewer than ten employees. Farming and fishing are important in combination with the food industry. A few high-profile technology companies contribute to a prosperous economy. Wind power is rapidly developing, aiming at reversing the direction in the cables to the mainland in coming years. In December 2011 wind power accounted for 31.48% of Åland's total electricity usage.The main ports are Mariehamn (south), Berghamn (west) and Långnäs on the eastern shore of the Main Island.Mariehamn was the base for the last large oceanic commercial sailing ships in the world. Their final tasks were bringing Australian wheat to Great Britain, on which Åland shipowner Gustaf Erikson kept going until after WW2, 1947 being his last year. The ships latterly made only one round-trip from South Australia to Britain per year, (the grain race), after each marathon voyage going back to Mariehamn to lay up for a few months. The ship Pommern, now a museum in Mariehamn, was one of these last vessels.The abolition of tax-free sales on ferry boats travelling between destinations within the European Union made Finland demand an exception for the Åland Islands on the European Union value added tax rules. The exception allows for maintained tax-free sales on the ferries between Sweden and Finland (provided they stop at Mariehamn or Långnäs) and at the airport, but has also made Åland a different tax-zone, meaning that tariffs must be levied on goods brought to the islands.Unemployment was 3.9% in January 2014 [14]The Finnish State collects taxes, duties and fees also in Åland. In return, the Finnish Government places a sum of money at the disposal of the Åland Parliament. The sum is 0.45% of total Government income, excluding Government loans. If the sum paid to the Finnish state exceedes 0.5%, then any amount above that will go back to the Parliament of Åland as \"diligence money\".[15] In 2010, the amount of taxes paid by Åland Islanders was 0.65% of the total taxes paid in Finland.[16]According to Eurostat, in 2006 Åland was the 20th wealthiest of the EU's 268 regions, and the wealthiest in Finland, with a GDP per inhabitant 47% above the EU mean.[17][18]While the official currency is the Euro, the Swedish krona is unofficially accepted by most businesses in Åland.[19]Births and deaths:[20]Most inhabitants speak Swedish (the sole official language) as their first language: 90.2% in 2009, while 5.0% spoke Finnish. The language of instruction in publicly financed schools is Swedish (In the rest of Finland, bilingual municipalities provide schooling both in Finnish and in Swedish). (See Åland Swedish for information about the dialect.)The issue of the ethnicity of the Ålanders, and the correct linguistic classification of their language, remains somewhat sensitive and controversial. They may be considered either ethnic Swedes or Swedish-speaking Finns, but their language is closer to the Uppländska dialect of Sweden than to Finland Swedish. See Languages of Sweden.Regional citizenship or the right of domicile (hembygdsrätt) is a prerequisite for voting, standing as a candidate for the Legislative Assembly, or owning and holding real estate situated in unplanned areas of Åland.The majority of the population, 78.3%, belongs to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland.[21] The Åland islands contain Finland's oldest Christian churches, including St. Olaf's Church, Jomala, which dating from the late 13th century is likely to be the oldest in Finland. The Åland Islands' largest church is the Church of St. George in Sund, dating from shortly after.[22]","path":[82500,9.145052,53.89359,82200,9.14266,53.89228,82080,9.140395,53.89104,81900,9.136915,53.8895,81720,9.132845,53.88832,81540,9.126348,53.88703,81360,9.118723,53.88555,81180,9.109695,53.88391,81060,9.104798,53.88337,80880,9.100422,53.88289,80760,9.0957,53.88243,80580,9.088458,53.88148,80400,9.078782,53.87975,80220,9.069147,53.87781,80100,9.059484,53.87543,79920,9.04975,53.87254,79800,9.041839,53.86922,79620,9.03495,53.86488,79500,9.030118,53.85965,79320,9.019633,53.85624,79140,9.00688,53.8532,78960,8.990811,53.85081,78780,8.977511,53.84919,78600,8.965227,53.8476,78480,8.952722,53.84616,78240,8.937215,53.84439,78060,8.92358,53.84327,77940,8.910597,53.84207,77760,8.89832,53.84103,77580,8.883801,53.83979,77400,8.871302,53.83884,77280,8.859538,53.83846,77100,8.8457,53.83822,76920,8.831839,53.83787,76800,8.823874,53.83741,76620,8.810182,53.83729,76500,8.799844,53.83787,76320,8.78429,53.84023,76080,8.77182,53.84345,75960,8.759893,53.84764,75780,8.748212,53.85371,75600,8.739493,53.85863,75480,8.731292,53.86374,75300,8.725344,53.86987,75120,8.715029,53.87574,74940,8.705495,53.88145,74760,8.699028,53.88806,74460,8.68633,53.9013,74160,8.675404,53.9127,73860,8.663208,53.92577,73560,8.647513,53.93941,73320,8.632813,53.94689,72960,8.609578,53.9553,72360,8.5658,53.9629,72060,8.539528,53.96677,66060,8.123928,53.95399,65460,8.090234,53.94333,65340,8.08305,53.94105,64920,8.06413,53.93094,64740,8.060971,53.92519,64560,8.059562,53.92049,64440,8.05921,53.91531,64260,8.059664,53.90999,64140,8.05995,53.90391,63900,8.059898,53.89657,62340,8.11704,53.86094,53100,8.496635,53.61013,52680,8.51446,53.59458,52500,8.522676,53.58694,52320,8.529685,53.57951,52140,8.537608,53.57162,51960,8.544,53.5649,51840,8.550078,53.55862,51660,8.556831,53.55213,51480,8.56349,53.54551,51360,8.569595,53.53906,51180,8.576127,53.53518,51060,8.578359,53.53329,50940,8.578241,53.53198,49680,8.578285,53.53178,49500,8.578203,53.53122,49320,8.577733,53.52982,49140,8.577568,53.52865,48960,8.577088,53.52839,48780,8.576145,53.52794,48600,8.575452,53.52652,48420,8.575213,53.52375,48300,8.575747,53.52088,48120,8.576903,53.51826,48000,8.578999,53.51547,47760,8.582235,53.51141,46560,8.58311,53.51093,45300,8.583128,53.51092,44040,8.583127,53.51095,42600,8.583108,53.51095,41340,8.583165,53.5109,40080,8.583112,53.51097,38820,8.583002,53.51091,38640,8.582858,53.51005,38520,8.582998,53.50755,38340,8.581772,53.50537,38220,8.581939,53.50355,37860,8.582111,53.50352,36600,8.582124,53.50354,35340,8.582105,53.50352,34080,8.582078,53.5035,32820,8.582047,53.5035,31560,8.58203,53.50348,30300,8.582042,53.50351,29040,8.582117,53.50349,27780,8.582124,53.50349,26520,8.582095,53.50348,25200,8.582042,53.50351,23940,8.582078,53.50353,22680,8.582042,53.50354,21240,8.582097,53.50354,19980,8.582105,53.50351,18720,8.582055,53.50352,17460,8.582111,53.50348,16020,8.582038,53.50355,14760,8.582097,53.50359,13500,8.582111,53.50348,12240,8.582075,53.50353,10980,8.582088,53.50354,9720,8.582037,53.50354,8460,8.582169,53.50362,7200,8.582035,53.50348,5940,8.582055,53.5035,4680,8.582067,53.50357,3420,8.582017,53.5035,2160,8.582097,53.50357,900,8.582129,53.50357]},{"name":"FEHN POLLUX","text":"FEHN POLLUX:Pollux, also designated Beta Geminorum (β Geminorum, abbreviated Beta Gem, β Gem), is an orange-hued evolved giant star approximately 34 light-years from the Sun in the northern constellation of Gemini. It is the closest giant star to the Sun.Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.[14] In 2006, an extrasolar planet (designated Pollux b or β Gem b, later named Thestias) was confirmed to be orbiting it.[8]The traditional name Pollux refers specifically to the twins Castor and Pollux in Greek and Roman mythology.[15] In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)[16] to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016[17] included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Pollux for this star. Castor and Pollux are the two \"heavenly twin\" stars giving the constellation Gemini (Latin, 'the twins') its name. The stars, however, are quite different in detail. Castor is a complex sextuple system of hot, bluish-white A-type stars and dim red dwarfs, while Pollux is a single, cooler yellow-orange giant. In Percy Shelley's 1818 poem Homer's Hymn To Castor And Pollux, the star is referred to as \"..mild Pollux, void of blame.\"[18] Following its discovery the planet was designated Pollux b. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.[19] The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.[20] In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Thestias for this planet.[21] The winning name was based on that originally submitted by theSkyNet of Australia; namely Leda, Pollux's mother. At the request of the IAU, 'Thestias' (the patronym of Leda, a daughter of Thestius) was substituted. This was because 'Leda' was already attributed to an asteroid and to one of Jupiter's satellites.[22][23]In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, this star was designated Muekher al Dzira, which was translated into Latin as Posterior Brachii, meaning the end in the paw.[24]In Chinese, 北河 (Běi Hé), meaning North River, refers to an asterism consisting of Pollux, ρ Geminorum and Castor.[25] Consequently, Pollux itself is known as 北河三 (Běi Hé sān, English: the Third Star of North River.)","path":[72960,7.429315,54.21755,72660,7.449677,54.20868,72420,7.45967,54.20193,72300,7.467098,54.19633,72120,7.473903,54.18931,72000,7.478092,54.18465,71820,7.483168,54.17916,71640,7.489697,54.17213,71520,7.49537,54.16575,71520,7.49537,54.16575,71400,7.498652,54.16227,71280,7.503032,54.15734,71100,7.509235,54.15057,70980,7.513922,54.14551,70800,7.519629,54.1391,70680,7.524675,54.13345,70380,7.534742,54.12219,70200,7.541292,54.11493,69840,7.554214,54.10047,69660,7.560277,54.09349,69420,7.567635,54.08509,69300,7.5731,54.07923,69180,7.576746,54.07549,69060,7.581968,54.07007,68820,7.58962,54.062,68700,7.594274,54.05703,68520,7.599735,54.05132,68340,7.607092,54.04356,68220,7.612532,54.03786,68040,7.618335,54.0318,67920,7.623283,54.02639,67800,7.627805,54.02183,67680,7.631351,54.01801,67560,7.636353,54.01276,67560,7.636353,54.01276,67380,7.641295,54.00772,67260,7.6457,54.00266,67080,7.651,53.99705,66900,7.656527,53.99104,66780,7.661997,53.98526,66660,7.667035,53.97986,66540,7.670678,53.97594,66300,7.678798,53.96729,66120,7.685902,53.95991,65940,7.692135,53.95361,65760,7.69836,53.94737,65580,7.705425,53.93989,65400,7.712343,53.93288,65220,7.718897,53.92601,65100,7.724222,53.92055,64920,7.729915,53.91455,64800,7.735048,53.90913,64560,7.74445,53.89941,64260,7.755092,53.88983,64020,7.769433,53.88515,63900,7.779905,53.88199,63540,7.802778,53.87943,63540,7.802778,53.87943,63240,7.82528,53.877,63000,7.841495,53.87534,62820,7.855222,53.87377,62820,7.855222,53.87377,62640,7.867808,53.87239,62400,7.879923,53.87178,62220,7.886977,53.86912,62100,7.895505,53.86552,61920,7.903702,53.86217,61740,7.913713,53.85895,61560,7.928777,53.85874,61380,7.942695,53.85859,61200,7.95475,53.85843,61080,7.964169,53.85721,60600,7.998397,53.85291,60420,8.010395,53.85135,60240,8.021156,53.84929,60120,8.032015,53.84735,59940,8.043206,53.84504,59760,8.052665,53.84242,59640,8.061358,53.83998,59520,8.070127,53.83752,59340,8.080096,53.83471,59220,8.08783,53.83259,59100,8.096668,53.83002,58740,8.113361,53.82181,52260,8.48835,53.61465,52020,8.500769,53.60539,51900,8.508324,53.59943,51720,8.515473,53.59246,51480,8.526733,53.5812,51300,8.537217,53.57119,51120,8.543872,53.56458,51000,8.55125,53.5566,50820,8.558168,53.54949,50700,8.564732,53.54248,50460,8.569118,53.53283,50340,8.56579,53.52663,50220,8.557857,53.52272,50040,8.550094,53.51958,49920,8.541607,53.51613,49740,8.531727,53.51199,49560,8.521655,53.50751,49380,8.51109,53.49934,49260,8.504066,53.49224,49080,8.498438,53.48533,48960,8.4952,53.47713,48780,8.493908,53.46971,48660,8.49262,53.46138,48480,8.491177,53.45285,48240,8.491154,53.4404,48060,8.492144,53.43179,47940,8.493307,53.42251,47760,8.49451,53.41275,47580,8.495688,53.40407,47400,8.496747,53.39549,47280,8.49772,53.3868,47100,8.49876,53.37774,46860,8.499447,53.36659,46740,8.4997,53.36,46500,8.500598,53.35698,46260,8.497414,53.35667,44940,8.497282,53.3566,43500,8.497222,53.35662,42240,8.49726,53.3567,40980,8.497236,53.35661,39720,8.497276,53.35662,38460,8.497336,53.35661,37200,8.497242,53.35666,35760,8.497349,53.35646,34500,8.497238,53.35671,33240,8.497249,53.35661,31980,8.497177,53.35659,30720,8.497213,53.35678,29460,8.49738,53.35677,28200,8.497255,53.35662,26940,8.497184,53.35667,25500,8.49726,53.35666,24240,8.497292,53.3566,22980,8.497323,53.35659,21720,8.497125,53.35663,20460,8.49729,53.35669,19200,8.497267,53.35663,17760,8.497122,53.35673,16500,8.497231,53.35671,15240,8.497323,53.35658,13980,8.497265,53.35663,12720,8.497233,53.35667,11460,8.497187,53.35664,10200,8.497242,53.3566,8580,8.497276,53.35659,7320,8.497293,53.35676,6060,8.49721,53.35659,4620,8.497289,53.35666,3360,8.497269,53.35665,2100,8.497334,53.35665,840,8.49727,53.3566]},{"name":"HAM 317","text":"HAM 317:Ham is pork that has been preserved through salting, smoking, or wet curing.[1] It was traditionally made only from the hind leg of swine, and referred to that specific cut of pork.[2] Ham is made around the world, including a number of highly coveted regional specialties, such as Westphalian ham and Jamón serrano. Technically a processed meat, \"ham\" may refer to a product which has been through mechanical re-forming.The precise nature of meat termed \"ham\" is controlled in a number of areas, often by statute, including the United States and European Union. In addition, numerous ham products have specific geographical naming protection, such as Prosciutto di Parma and Prosciutto Toscano PDO in Europe, and Smithfield ham in the US.The preserving of pork leg as ham has a long history, with Cato the Elder writing about the \"salting of hams\" in his De Agri Cultura tome around 160 BC.[3]There are claims that the Chinese were the first people to mention the production of cured ham,[4] whilst Larousse Gastronomique claims an origin from Gaul,[5] but it was certainly well established by the Roman period, including an import trade from Gaul mentioned by Marcus Terentius Varro in his writings.[4]The modern word \"ham\" is derived from the Old English ham or hom meaning the hollow or bend of the knee, from a Germanic base where it meant \"crooked\". It began to refer to the cut of pork derived from the hind leg of a swine around the 15th century.[6] Preservation methods include curing, smoking, and salting.Because of the preservation process, ham is a compound foodstuff or ingredient, being made up of the original meat, as well as the remnants of the preserving agent(s), such as salt, but it is still recognised as a food in its own right.[7]Labeling. In many countries the term is now protected by statute, with a specific definition. For instance, in the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) says that \"the word 'ham', without any prefix indicating the species of animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling only in connection with the hind legs of swine\".[8] In addition to the main categories, some processing choices can affect legal labeling. For instance, in the United States, a \"smoked\" ham must have been smoked by hanging over burning wood chips in a smokehouse or an atomized spray of liquid smoke such that the product appearance is equivalent; a \"hickory-smoked\" ham must have been smoked using only hickory. However, injecting \"smoke flavor\" is not legal grounds for claiming the ham was \"smoked\"; these are labeled \"smoke flavor added\". Hams can only be labeled \"honey-cured\" if honey was at least 50% of the sweetener used, is at least 3% of the formula, and has a discernible effect on flavor. So-called \"lean\" and \"extra lean\" hams must adhere to maximum levels of fat and cholesterol per 100 grams of product. Ham re-formed from smaller pieces into a larger block also has to be labeled in many jurisdictions.Methods Ham is produced by preserving and flavoring raw pork by salting, smoking, or wet curing. Besides salt, several ingredients may be used to obtain flavoring and preservation, from black pepper (e.g. Prosciutto Toscano PDO) to the precious saffron (e.g. the \"Zafferano di San Gimignano PDO\"

is a non-profit news agency that reports on the Catholic Church and issues important to it from the perspective of Church doctrine. ZENIT's motto is, \"The world seen from Rome.\"The ZENIT website describes their perspective as one which is \"convinced of the extraordinary richness of the Catholic Church's message, particularly its social doctrine ... [and which] sees this message as a light for understanding today's world.\" ZENIT's \"compass is the social doctrine of the Church, summarized in the Compendium[1] published by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.\"[2]The name \"ZENIT\" means \"zenith\" in many languages, and refers to the highest point in the sky reached by the sun, a symbol associated with Jesus Christ by early Christians.[3]ZENIT began publication in 1997 and now publishes in seven languages. By its own account, ZENIT has 520,000 e-mail subscribers and its articles have been reprinted in more than 100,000 media sources.[3]A number of Catholic authors such as Christopher West[4] have cited ZENIT stories in printed works.On Thursday, September 29, 2011, it was stated that Jesus Colina, Zenit's publisher, resigned voluntarily at the request of the sponsoring Legionaries of Christ because he felt they had not let Zenit set up separate financial mechanisms to be more readily fiscally transparent which they supposedly had earlier promised to do, and also because he felt they were too evasive, selective and partial about the actual results and implications of the sex scandal involving Fr Marcial Maciel Degollado, the founder of the Legion.According to an online article by Catholic News Service (CNS) posted on Tuesday, October 11, 2011, John Thavis wrote, \"The six editors of the Catholic news agency Zenit have resigned, saying the agency has become too closely identified with the Legionaries of Christ.\" The editors of Zenit's French, Italian, Spanish, English, Portuguese and Arabic services in a statement said, \"The initial vision of Zenit was never to make it a service of a particular congregation, but rather of the universal church. This has been the spirit with which we have worked throughout the years, and the spirit we could not betray.\"[5]Zenit announced on Oct 13, 2011 that Antonio Gaspari would be its new editorial coordinator.[citation needed]According to the ZENIT website, the organization's publications are published and edited by Innovative Media Inc., and ZENIT works directly or in collaboration with the following non-profits internationally: Fundación ZENIT España in Spain, Association ZENIT in France, ZENIT eV in Germany, and Asociacao ZENIT in Brazil.[3]Innovative Media Inc. is a non-profit based in New York, according to ZENIT, and is registered as a non-profit organization in Atlanta, Georgia.[6][7][8] Its president is Antonio Maza.[9]ZENIT says it was funded during its first three years in large part by Aid to the Church in Need, the Italian Bishops' Conference and the Legion of Christ.[10] As of 2007, ZENIT says it is funded 75% by reader donations and 13% by institutions and benefactors.[11]A 2006 report in Commonweal magazine alleged that Innovative Media is a \"front\" for the Legion of Christ.[12]","path":[82500,8.58237,53.53798,81180,8.58237,53.53796,79920,8.582398,53.53795,78540,8.582361,53.53799,77280,8.582405,53.53794,75900,8.582376,53.53794,74580,8.582383,53.53797,73200,8.582336,53.53798,71880,8.582361,53.53794,70500,8.582376,53.53796,69180,8.582368,53.53793,67860,8.582397,53.53794,66600,8.582367,53.53794,65280,8.582374,53.53797,64020,8.58238,53.53792,62700,8.58239,53.53794,61380,8.58237,53.53793,60120,8.582374,53.53794,58800,8.582397,53.53794,57540,8.582374,53.53797,56280,8.582365,53.53794,54960,8.58237,53.53793,53580,8.582407,53.53794,52320,8.582352,53.53794,51000,8.582381,53.53797,49680,8.58244,53.53792,49560,8.582418,53.5379,49320,8.580087,53.53667,49200,8.570995,53.53543,49020,8.56317,53.54062,48900,8.557812,53.54663,48780,8.552385,53.55242,48540,8.544329,53.56124,48420,8.538647,53.56736,48240,8.5328,53.5731,48120,8.527735,53.57803,47940,8.521685,53.58406,47820,8.515674,53.5901,47640,8.509495,53.59624,47520,8.501337,53.60192,47340,8.493087,53.60768,47160,8.483532,53.61378,47040,8.473839,53.61845,46920,8.466927,53.62335,46740,8.465988,53.63074,46560,8.463638,53.63783,46440,8.456306,53.64424,46260,8.44953,53.64942,46140,8.440362,53.65461,45960,8.429557,53.66007,45780,8.420629,53.66527,45600,8.41239,53.67167,45420,8.406647,53.67824,45240,8.403183,53.68614,44880,8.390634,53.7013,44580,8.377769,53.71593,44340,8.370113,53.72433,28380,8.24591,53.8354,27960,8.260362,53.83497,27780,8.247545,53.83577,24660,8.295838,53.75885,24480,8.310627,53.75347,23760,8.361403,53.73126,23580,8.3745,53.72234,23400,8.381725,53.71435,23220,8.388037,53.70726,23040,8.39487,53.69921,22800,8.403988,53.68501,22560,8.41072,53.6738,22320,8.421532,53.66552,22200,8.431646,53.65957,22020,8.44219,53.6536,21840,8.450499,53.64699,21660,8.4612,53.64004,21540,8.467089,53.63241,21360,8.474658,53.62469,21180,8.48432,53.61804,21060,8.492817,53.61215,20880,8.500638,53.60622,20760,8.50859,53.60031,20580,8.515803,53.59478,20460,8.522304,53.58909,20220,8.529678,53.58194,20100,8.535666,53.57522,19920,8.54156,53.56901,19800,8.54789,53.56249,19620,8.553733,53.55627,19500,8.558534,53.55108,19320,8.562609,53.54647,19200,8.567015,53.54108,19080,8.571275,53.53628,18840,8.581783,53.53749,18480,8.582358,53.53796,17100,8.582367,53.53797,15780,8.582376,53.5379,14520,8.582358,53.53798,13140,8.582375,53.53796,11820,8.58233,53.53799,10500,8.58234,53.53797,9180,8.58238,53.53795,7800,8.582392,53.53793,6420,8.582378,53.53794,4980,8.58238,53.53795,3720,8.582335,53.53798,2340,8.582305,53.53798,1080,8.582374,53.53795]},{"name":"GEESTEMUENDE","text":"GEESTEMUENDE:Bremerhaven (German pronunciation: [bʁeːmɐˈhaːfən] ( listen), literally \"Bremen's harbour\", Low German: Bremerhoben) is a city at the seaport of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, a state of the Federal Republic of Germany. It forms an enclave in the state of Lower Saxony and is located at the mouth of the River Weser on its eastern bank, opposite the town of Nordenham. Though a relatively new city, it has a long history as a trade port and today is one of the most important German ports, playing a crucial role in Germany's trade.The town was founded in 1827, but settlements, such as Lehe, were in the vicinity as early as the 12th century, and Geestendorf, which was \"mentioned in documents of the ninth century\".[2] These tiny villages were built on small islands in the swampy estuary. In 1381, the city of Bremen established de facto rule over the lower Weser stream, including Lehe, later therefore called Bremerlehe. Early in 1653, Swedish Bremen-Verden's troops captured Bremerlehe by force.The Emperor Ferdinand III ordered his vassal Christina of Sweden, then Duchess regnant of Bremen-Verden, to restitute Bremerlehe to Bremen. However, Swedish Bremen-Verden soon enacted the First Bremian War (March to July 1654) and in the following peace treaty (First Stade Recess (de); November 1654) Bremen had to cede Bremerlehe and its surroundings to Swedish Bremen-Verden. The latter developed plans to found a fortified town on the site, and much later this location became the present-day city of Bremerhaven. In 1672, under the reign of Charles XI of Sweden, in personal union Duke of Bremen-Verden—colonists tried unsuccessfully to erect a castle (named Carlsburg after Charles XI) there; this fortified structure was meant to protect, as well as control shipping heading for Bremen.Finally, in 1827, the city of Bremen under Burgomaster Johann Smidt bought the territories at the mouth of the Weser from the Kingdom of Hanover. Bremen sought this territory to retain its share of Germany's overseas trade, which was threatened by the silting up of the Weser around the old inland port of Bremen. Bremerhaven (literally in English: Bremener Haven/Harbour) was founded to be a haven for Bremen's merchant marine, becoming the second harbour for Bremen, despite being 50 km (31 mi) downstream. Due to trade with, and emigration to North America, the port and the town grew quickly. In 1848, Bremerhaven became the home port of the German Confederation's Navy under Karl Rudolf Brommy.The Kingdom of Hanover founded a rival town next to Bremerhaven and called it Geestemünde (1845). Both towns grew and established the three economic pillars of trade, shipbuilding and fishing. Following inter-state negotiations at different times, Bremerhaven's boundary was several times extended at the expense of Hanoveran territory. In 1924, Geestemünde and the neighbouring municipality of Lehe were united to become the new city of Wesermünde, and in 1939 Bremerhaven (apart from the overseas port) was removed from the jurisdiction of Bremen and made a part of Wesermünde, then a part of the Prussian Province of Hanover.Bremerhaven was one of the important harbours of emigration in Europe.[3]As possibly the most critical North Sea base of the Nazi War Navy, the Kriegsmarine, most of the city was destroyed in the allied air bombing of Bremen in World War II; however, key parts of the port were deliberately spared[citation needed] by the Allied forces to provide a usable harbour for supplying the Allies after the war. All of Wesermünde, including those parts, which did not previously belong to Bremerhaven, was a postwar enclave run by the United States within the British zone of northern Germany. Most of the US military units and their personnel were assigned to the city's Carl Schurz Kaserne. One of the longest US units based on the Kaserne was a US military radio and TV station, an “Amerikanischer Soldatensender,” AFN Bremerhaven, which broadcast for 48 years. In 1993, the Kaserne was vacated by the US military and returned to the German government. In 1947 the city became part of the federal state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and was consequently renamed from Wesermünde to Bremerhaven. Today, Bremerhaven is therefore part of the city-state of Bremen, being to all intents and purposes a state comprising two cities, while also a city in its own right. This is complicated somewhat by the fact that the city of Bremen has owned the \"overseas port\" within Bremerhaven since 1927. To further complicate matters, a treaty between the two cities (as mentioned in Section 8 of Bremerhaven's municipal constitution) makes Bremerhaven responsible for the municipal administration of those parts owned directly by Bremen (known as stadtbremisch).[4]The port of Bremerhaven is the sixteenth-largest container port in the world and the fourth-largest in Europe with 4.9 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of cargo handled in 2007[5] and 5,5 million in 2015.[6] The container terminal is situated on the bank of the river Weser opening to the north-sea. In the wet dock parts, accessible by two large locks, more than 2 million cars are imported or exported every year with 2,3 million in 2014. Bremerhaven imports and exports more cars than any other city in Europe. Another million tons of \"High-and-Heavy\" goods are handled with ro-ro ships. In 2011 a new panamax-sized lock has replaced the 1897 Kaiserschleuse, then the largest lock worldwide.The river Weser flows by Bremen to the estuary at Bremerhaven (top).Skyline of Havenwelten-districtOverseas port of Bremerhaven.The MSC Venezuela docking at Bremerhaven's container port.Locks and Docks around Lloyd WerftBremerhaven has a temperate maritime climate; severe frost and heat waves with temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) are rare. On average, the city receives about 742 mm (29.2 in) of precipitation distributed throughout the year, with a slight peak in the summer months between June and August. The hottest temperature ever recorded was 35.8 °C (96.4 °F) on 9 August 1992, and the coldest was −18.6 °C (−1.5 °F) on 25 February 1956.[7]Due to its unique geographic situation, Bremerhaven suffers from a few transportational difficulties. The city has been connected to the autobahn network since the late 1970s. The A 27 runs north-south, east of the city, connecting Bremerhaven to Bremen and Cuxhaven. Road connections to Hamburg, however, are poor. The Bundesstraße 71 and secondary roads therefore carry most of the heavy lorry traffic. A proposed solution is the construction of the A 22, the so-called Küstenautobahn (or \"coastal motorway\"), which would link Bremerhaven to Hamburg and Wilhelmshaven/Oldenburg (using the Weser tunnel). Roads leading to the overseas port are regularly overloaded with freight traffic, and solutions are presently being discussed, including a deep-cut road favoured by the city government and various interest groups.Bremerhaven has three active passenger rail stations, Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof in the city centre, Bremerhaven-Lehe north of the centre and Bremerhaven-Wulsdorf in the southern part of the city. A fourth station, Bremerhaven-Speckenbüttel near the border to Langen has been out of service since 1988, though it might reopen when the Bremen S-Bahn scheme becomes operational. Bremerhaven's central station lost its last long-distance train in 2001. Now only regional connections to Bremen, Cuxhaven, Osnabrück and Hannover are available. The railways in Bremerhaven, however, still carry a heavy load of freight traffic, mostly new cars, containers and food.Bremerhaven has only a few historical buildings, and the high street and city centre are almost entirely post-war. The main attractions for tourists are found at the Havenwelten and include the German Emigration Center (since August 8, 2005) and the German Maritime Museum (Deutsches Schiffahrtsmuseum) from 1975, featuring the Hansekogge, a vintage cog dating from 1380, excavated in Bremen in 1962, and the historical harbour (Museumshafen) with a number of museum ships, such as the Type XXI U-boat Wilhelm Bauer (a museum of its own), the Seute Deern (a wooden three-masted sailing vessel), and the salvage tug Seefalke from 1924. The Bremerhaven Zoo reopened on 27 March 2004, after a lengthy renovation. It features Arctic wildlife, both terrestrial and marine. The latest addition is the Klimahaus from 2009, simulating travel adventure along the 8th line of longitude and dealing with climate issues. Two gazebos can be found on top of the Atlantic Hotel Sail City and the Radar Tower. Another tourist spot is the Fischereihafen (fishing port) in Geestemünde which also houses an aquarium (the Atlanticum). The Lloyd-Werft shipyard is renowned for building and renovating large cruise liners, for example the Norway.Every five years Sail Bremerhaven is held, a large sailing convention that attracts tall ships from all over the world. The last time it was held was in 2015 with over 270 vessels and 3,500 crew members.[10] In 2011 Bremerhaven set the record for the largest ever parade of boats, with 327 vessels in the parade. This record was broken in 2012 by the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, with 1,000 boats.[11]The passenger terminal Columbuskaje, built at the Weser bank in 1927 to avoid time-absorbing locking, has been transferred into a cruise terminal (Columbus Cruise Center Bremerhaven/CCCB). Also three marinas are available, the latest accessible through a new lock at Neuer Hafen.Bremerhaven has a city council with 49 members.The Fischtown Pinguins, also known as REV Bremerhaven, is a professional ice hockey team in the DEL, Germany's top Ice Hockey league.The Eisbären Bremerhaven (Polarbears), founded 2001, is a basketball team playing in the 1st division of the Basketball Bundesliga.Bremerhaven is home to the Alfred Wegener Institute, a national research institute which is concerned with maritime sciences and climate and keeps a number of research vessels, amongst them the heavy research icebreaker RV Polarstern. It also runs the Neumayer-Station III in the Antarctic.The Fraunhofer Society Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology (German Wikipedia) maintains research laboratories in Bremerhaven for development and testing of Wind Power components.[12]The German Maritime Museum is part of the German Leibniz Association.The Bremerhaven University of Applied Sciences/Hochschule Bremerhaven was founded in 1975 and is expanding since with more than 3.000 students in 2009.Bremerhaven is twinned with:The three roads connecting the city of Bremerhaven to the Autobahn 27 consequently are named after the original three twin cities:In addition to that there are also streets which earlier had been named after Szczecin (Stettiner Straße) and Kaliningrad (Königsberger Straße).","path":[81540,8.572224,53.54489,80220,8.572164,53.54489,79020,8.572218,53.54488,77580,8.572211,53.54486,76320,8.57221,53.54488,75060,8.572233,53.54489,73620,8.572204,53.54487,72360,8.572218,53.54489,71100,8.572185,53.54486,69840,8.572208,53.54487,68580,8.572205,53.54487,67320,8.572202,53.54487,66060,8.572227,53.54487,64620,8.572191,53.54485,63180,8.572224,53.54486,61920,8.572206,53.54488,60660,8.572205,53.54487,59400,8.572197,53.54487,58140,8.572186,53.54487,56880,8.572202,53.54486,55620,8.572204,53.54489,54360,8.572198,53.54487,53100,8.572177,53.54485,51840,8.572195,53.54487,50580,8.572133,53.54487,50460,8.571985,53.54509,50340,8.571513,53.54614,50220,8.570527,53.5462,49800,8.570593,53.54617,49680,8.570447,53.54607,49380,8.56962,53.54272,49260,8.571335,53.53997,49140,8.571562,53.53644,48900,8.563487,53.54119,48780,8.559558,53.5454,48600,8.555331,53.54965,48480,8.551614,53.55367,48360,8.547802,53.55776,48180,8.543237,53.56222,48000,8.538845,53.56655,47880,8.534965,53.57051,47700,8.53045,53.57493,47580,8.525858,53.57952,47340,8.518855,53.5858,47220,8.513721,53.59047,47040,8.508598,53.59533,46920,8.502943,53.59943,46740,8.497113,53.60323,46620,8.491395,53.60708,46500,8.488553,53.60969,46320,8.49585,53.61055,46200,8.504958,53.60403,46020,8.512567,53.5987,45840,8.518619,53.5941,45720,8.525023,53.58767,45540,8.529714,53.5827,45420,8.534885,53.57692,45240,8.540644,53.57067,45120,8.546302,53.5645,45000,8.551768,53.55883,44820,8.555489,53.55403,44700,8.561203,53.54922,44520,8.567455,53.54455,44400,8.569995,53.54591,43740,8.571069,53.54659,43560,8.571898,53.54545,42240,8.57219,53.54493,42060,8.571673,53.54583,41940,8.569863,53.54867,41760,8.566524,53.55146,41400,8.56588,53.55193,41280,8.565805,53.55215,41160,8.565158,53.55288,40920,8.562903,53.55544,40800,8.561303,53.55767,40560,8.559881,53.55879,39300,8.559958,53.55798,37980,8.5599,53.55799,36540,8.559923,53.55812,36420,8.559894,53.55805,36300,8.559506,53.55687,36060,8.55933,53.55217,35940,8.563233,53.54813,35820,8.563309,53.54404,35580,8.560014,53.54605,35460,8.557768,53.54788,35280,8.555364,53.54957,35160,8.553033,53.55177,35040,8.549857,53.55519,34860,8.545315,53.55967,34740,8.540502,53.56432,34560,8.535642,53.56982,34440,8.530599,53.57496,34320,8.525623,53.57922,34080,8.517877,53.58637,33960,8.514553,53.59081,33780,8.508618,53.59655,33660,8.502784,53.60041,33480,8.49664,53.605,33300,8.48774,53.6095,33180,8.480967,53.61388,33000,8.473165,53.61819,32880,8.467123,53.62238,32760,8.46741,53.62765,32580,8.465558,53.63319,32460,8.462087,53.63923,32280,8.456402,53.64377,32160,8.450543,53.64858,31920,8.442775,53.65331,31800,8.439631,53.65352,31620,8.440884,53.65341,31500,8.440494,53.65357,31200,8.440418,53.65463,31020,8.445915,53.65132,30840,8.453462,53.64583,30720,8.46232,53.63972,30540,8.466125,53.63335,30420,8.46932,53.62719,30240,8.476528,53.62247,30120,8.484946,53.61803,29940,8.49181,53.61335,29820,8.499,53.60782,29640,8.505223,53.60292,29520,8.510999,53.59811,29400,8.517285,53.59371,29220,8.52281,53.58869,29100,8.527808,53.5839,28920,8.533013,53.57877,28800,8.53767,53.57317,28560,8.545299,53.5645,28440,8.55028,53.55936,28200,8.556828,53.55281,28080,8.562555,53.54794,27900,8.567333,53.5438,27780,8.569892,53.54575,27540,8.570497,53.54617,27300,8.571237,53.54657,27120,8.572193,53.54515,26580,8.572097,53.54495,25320,8.57221,53.54487,24060,8.572191,53.54487,22620,8.572197,53.54487,21180,8.572185,53.54487,19920,8.572185,53.54487,18480,8.57219,53.54487,17040,8.572182,53.54487,15780,8.572205,53.54487,14520,8.572198,53.5449,13260,8.572185,53.54488,11820,8.572198,53.54487,10560,8.57219,53.54489,9300,8.572191,53.54487,7860,8.572208,53.54487,6600,8.572208,53.54487,5340,8.572208,53.54487,4080,8.57218,53.54488,2820,8.572186,53.54489,1560,8.572198,53.54487,300,8.5722,53.54489]},{"name":"BUGSIER 9","text":"BUGSIER 9:Bugsie was one of the names in a word find that had to be solved to win a copy of the Challenge of the Gobots video game from Your Sinclair magazine.[8]BuggyMan is a Renegade Gobot who turns into a dune buggy.

Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) is the U.S. government's central database on known or suspected international terrorists, and contains highly[clarify] classified information provided by members of the Intelligence Community such as CIA, DIA, FBI, NSA, and many others.There are over one million names in TIDE.[1] In 2008, more than 27,000 names were removed from the list when it was determined they no longer met the criteria for inclusion. According to the FBI, international terrorists include those persons who carry out terrorist activities under foreign direction. For this purpose, they may include U.S. persons (U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents).[2] The Terrorist Identities Group (TIG), located in NCTC's Information Sharing & Knowledge Development Directorate (ISKD), is responsible for building and maintaining TIDE.[3]From the classified TIDE database, an unclassified, but sensitive, extract is provided to the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, which compiles the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).This database, in turn, is used to compile various watch lists such as the TSA's No Fly List, State Department's Consular Lookout and Support System, Homeland Security's Interagency Border Inspection System, and FBI's NCIC (National Crime Information Center) for state and local law enforcement.","path":[82680,8.58343,53.53167,81420,8.583457,53.53168,80160,8.583425,53.53165,78900,8.58343,53.53167,77640,8.58341,53.53169,76380,8.583428,53.53166,75120,8.583425,53.53165,73860,8.58342,53.53168,72600,8.583406,53.53167,71340,8.583457,53.53168,70080,8.583435,53.53167,68820,8.583433,53.53167,67560,8.58342,53.53164,66300,8.583475,53.53167,65040,8.583415,53.53167,63780,8.58343,53.5317,62520,8.583406,53.53168,61260,8.583385,53.53167,59820,8.58339,53.53164,58560,8.583426,53.53168,57300,8.583415,53.53171,56040,8.583442,53.53168,54780,8.583425,53.53165,53520,8.583411,53.53167,52260,8.583455,53.53171,51000,8.583418,53.53167,49740,8.583422,53.53168,48480,8.583438,53.53169,47220,8.583464,53.53165,45840,8.583433,53.53165,45660,8.57898,53.53071,45540,8.577592,53.53234,45000,8.577587,53.5324,44820,8.577193,53.53453,44640,8.568018,53.5275,44520,8.556788,53.52141,44340,8.54398,53.51585,44220,8.530927,53.51082,44040,8.520235,53.50541,43920,8.51042,53.49871,43740,8.501965,53.49045,43560,8.496636,53.4806,43380,8.494097,53.46914,43200,8.492415,53.45917,43080,8.491241,53.45036,42900,8.492064,53.44116,42780,8.493399,53.43138,42660,8.494467,53.42344,42480,8.495744,53.41283,42300,8.49677,53.40141,42120,8.497581,53.39179,41940,8.498485,53.38229,41820,8.49944,53.37421,41640,8.500907,53.36492,41520,8.501411,53.3564,41340,8.501594,53.34972,41220,8.498268,53.34155,41040,8.493368,53.33354,40920,8.490216,53.3271,40740,8.488664,53.31965,40620,8.489288,53.31482,40440,8.491101,53.30833,40260,8.491525,53.29842,40080,8.489952,53.28616,39840,8.486417,53.27651,39420,8.487783,53.27537,39240,8.485091,53.26592,37920,8.487322,53.27394,37620,8.483352,53.25824,36360,8.48599,53.26984,34800,8.4874,53.27534,34680,8.486696,53.27304,33540,8.48203,53.25919,32820,8.486604,53.27573,32640,8.486123,53.27243,32460,8.484445,53.26447,32040,8.481905,53.25831,31380,8.486961,53.27524,31200,8.487015,53.27453,31080,8.485853,53.26967,30660,8.483318,53.25803,29880,8.48725,53.27536,29700,8.486261,53.27541,29400,8.484455,53.27009,29280,8.48204,53.26277,28980,8.482325,53.25897,27900,8.485561,53.26359,26880,8.488628,53.31489,26700,8.487792,53.32361,26220,8.498487,53.34716,26040,8.499561,53.35743,25800,8.4977,53.37185,25560,8.496232,53.38521,25440,8.495452,53.39178,25260,8.494199,53.40105,25080,8.49301,53.41168,24900,8.491908,53.4202,24780,8.490788,53.42873,24600,8.489549,53.43727,24480,8.488862,53.44639,24300,8.48993,53.45426,24180,8.490737,53.46193,24000,8.491758,53.47086,23880,8.492557,53.47926,23700,8.496252,53.48675,23580,8.503132,53.49433,23400,8.511,53.50162,23220,8.522814,53.51009,23040,8.534427,53.51484,22920,8.54555,53.51921,22740,8.556628,53.52409,22620,8.564547,53.52987,22440,8.567119,53.53872,22320,8.568368,53.54481,21120,8.568521,53.54438,21000,8.571392,53.53988,20820,8.57592,53.53569,20700,8.58215,53.53764,20460,8.582227,53.53792,19140,8.582265,53.53788,18960,8.579984,53.53688,18780,8.578537,53.53633,18600,8.577838,53.53309,17940,8.577632,53.5325,17640,8.577394,53.53087,17400,8.577329,53.53069,17280,8.57957,53.53131,17160,8.583372,53.53175,16980,8.583422,53.53166,15660,8.58342,53.53167,14400,8.583426,53.53168,13140,8.583447,53.53166,11880,8.583451,53.53166,10620,8.583457,53.53169,9360,8.58345,53.53168,8100,8.583438,53.53168,6840,8.583415,53.53166,5580,8.58346,53.53167,4320,8.583397,53.53168,3060,8.583415,53.53168,1800,8.583426,53.53167,540,8.583457,53.53167]},{"name":"MAERSK NORTHWOOD","text":"MAERSK NORTHWOOD:A.P.

Møller – Maersk Group has activities in a variety of business sectors, primarily within the transportation and energy sectors. It has been the largest container ship operator and supply vessel operator in the world[4] since 1996.[5] As of September 2016 the company is in the process of splitting its shipping and energy interests into separate divisions.[6] A.P. Møller – Maersk Group is based in Copenhagen, Denmark,[7] with subsidiaries and offices in more than 135 countries worldwide and around 89,000 employees.[2] It ranked 148 on the Forbes Global 2000 list for 2015. A.P. Møller – Maersk Group started as the shipping company Dampskibsselskabet Svendborg (Danish for \"Svendborg Steamship Company\") founded by captain Peter Mærsk-Møller and his son Arnold Peter Møller (2 October 1876 - June 1965) in Svendborg, April 1904. A.P. Møller had four children, all by his first wife Chastine Estelle Roberta Mc-Kinney. A.P. Møller's second child was Arnold Mærsk Mc- Kinney Møller (13 July 1913 – 16 April 2012). In 1939, Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller became a partner in the company. Following the death of A.P. Møller in June 1965, he became CEO of the company and held this post until 1993, when he was succeeded by Jess Søderberg. Beginning in 1965, Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller also served as company chairman and did not relinquish this position until December 2003 (90 years old), when the chairmanship was taken over by Michael Pram Rasmussen. Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller was until his death one of the \"managing owners\" of the company and was chairman of Odense Steel Shipyard until 2 May 2006.[3]. Emblem[edit] P.M. Møller (1836–1927), who was a deeply religious Christian, attached a blue banner with a white seven pointed star on both sides of the black chimney on the steamship Laura when his wife recovered from illness. In a letter to his wife, P.M. Møller explained in October 1886, \"The little star on the chimney is a memory of the night when I prayed for you and asked for a sign: If a star would appear in the gray and cloudy sky, it would mean that the Lord answers prayers.\" The same star later became the emblem of the Maersk Group.MCC Transport is the Maersk Group's Intra-Asia specialist, focusing on the delivery of containerized cargo services in the dynamic and fast-growing Intra-Asia market through an extensive feeder network and a customer-focused team of professionals.","path":[75660,8.522977,53.59104,72600,8.523104,53.59104,49680,8.52313,53.59105,48420,8.523131,53.59123,47160,8.52321,53.59123,45900,8.523398,53.59106,44640,8.523235,53.59115,43380,8.522747,53.59108,43260,8.52196,53.59121,43140,8.521617,53.59178,43020,8.52078,53.59252,42840,8.518985,53.59371,42720,8.51554,53.59614,42540,8.511565,53.59859,42420,8.506224,53.60164,42300,8.501353,53.60453,42120,8.496758,53.60726,41940,8.492443,53.60992,41820,8.489143,53.61209,41580,8.482765,53.61591,41460,8.475402,53.6195,41280,8.465214,53.62391,41160,8.453823,53.62838,40980,8.44219,53.63326,40860,8.430304,53.63853,40680,8.419837,53.64331,40560,8.407641,53.64853,40380,8.39682,53.65407,40260,8.385741,53.66179,40080,8.374331,53.66959,39900,8.363132,53.67781,39720,8.349234,53.68746,39600,8.338701,53.69436,39360,8.319407,53.70341,39240,8.305623,53.70813,39000,8.284225,53.71609,38880,8.269847,53.7216,38640,8.250323,53.72908,38520,8.23786,53.73385,38400,8.226187,53.73825,38280,8.214478,53.74312,38040,8.198103,53.75256,37860,8.18415,53.76071,37680,8.17279,53.76807,37560,8.162113,53.77518,37440,8.153136,53.78247,37260,8.14051,53.79226,36960,8.121152,53.8071,36840,8.11322,53.81324,36660,8.103165,53.82121,36000,8.033975,53.844,33180,7.790815,53.89611,32820,7.78256,53.90279]},{"name":"R.T.INNOVATION","text":"R.T.INNOVATION:Innovation is defined simply as a \"new idea, device, or method\".[1] However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs.[2] This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \"innovation\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \"breaks into\" the market or society.[3] It is related to, but not the same as, invention.[4] While a novel device is often described as an innovation, in economics, management science, and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in a way that they affect society. In industrial economics, innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet the growing consumer demand.[5][6][7]In a survey of literature on innovation, Edison et al.[8] found over 40 definitions. They also performed an industrial survey to capture how innovation is defined in the software industry. After analysis of the existing definitions whether these definitions comprehensively cover all the dimensions of innovation, they found the following definition to be the most complete:\nInnovation is: production or adoption, assimilation, and exploitation of a value-added novelty in economic and social spheres; renewal and enlargement of products, services, and markets; development of new methods of production; and establishment of new management systems. It is both a process and an outcome.This definition was given by Crossan and Apaydin and it builds on the OECD manual's definition.Edison et al.[8] also found two interesting dimensions of innovation including: degree of novelty (i.e. whether an innovation is new to the firm, new to the market, new to the industry, and new to the world) and type of innovation (whether it is process or product/service innovation).","path":[81900,8.56055,53.55332,80580,8.560483,53.55335,79260,8.56055,53.55337,78960,8.5539,53.55377,78840,8.5498,53.55817,78660,8.545234,53.5626,78480,8.545883,53.56133,78300,8.548,53.56133,78120,8.54855,53.565,78000,8.549216,53.56728,77820,8.549633,53.56956,77640,8.549883,53.57117,76320,8.55005,53.57175,76200,8.5501,53.57283,76080,8.55045,53.57415,75780,8.551167,53.57475,75600,8.555067,53.57528,75420,8.5589,53.57638,75300,8.55965,53.5764,75000,8.559566,53.57665,73680,8.560083,53.57667,73560,8.5575,53.57533,73380,8.549666,53.5722,73260,8.549334,53.57205,72000,8.549467,53.57203,70680,8.549316,53.57215,69420,8.549267,53.5721,68160,8.549383,53.57208,67980,8.550417,53.57235,67800,8.5546,53.57588,67620,8.552317,53.57498,66720,8.552,53.57532,66540,8.55185,53.57512,66360,8.551583,53.57463,66120,8.552,53.57385,66000,8.551467,53.57368,65880,8.5497,53.57409,65760,8.550917,53.575,65640,8.55105,53.57455,65460,8.550517,53.57345,65340,8.550283,53.57232,65040,8.550134,53.5715,63780,8.549983,53.57125,63600,8.550083,53.57112,63480,8.550083,53.57048,63360,8.55,53.56956,63060,8.549684,53.56762,62940,8.549417,53.56648,62820,8.548583,53.5651,62640,8.548,53.56428,62520,8.5455,53.56518,62400,8.543467,53.56612,62160,8.539534,53.56647,61920,8.540417,53.5676,61800,8.537233,53.57025,61620,8.53395,53.57292,61500,8.529883,53.57727,61320,8.52685,53.5806,61140,8.525617,53.58352,60960,8.529533,53.58395,60180,8.5297,53.58413,60000,8.529567,53.58407,59760,8.529583,53.58293,59580,8.531834,53.58048,59400,8.5346,53.57727,59280,8.53675,53.57528,59100,8.539066,53.57293,58980,8.542417,53.5697,58800,8.545617,53.5659,58620,8.54905,53.56195,58500,8.552134,53.55862,58320,8.555883,53.55505,58140,8.560634,53.55315,57120,8.560433,53.55347,55740,8.560516,53.55337,54480,8.560467,53.5533,53100,8.5605,53.55337,51780,8.56055,53.55335,50340,8.560766,53.55337,49140,8.56075,53.55337,47820,8.560534,53.55345,46320,8.5608,53.5524,46200,8.553733,53.55328,46080,8.549216,53.55788,45840,8.54835,53.56592,45600,8.548217,53.56668,45420,8.54505,53.56445,45240,8.538466,53.568,45120,8.533433,53.57295,44940,8.528916,53.57717,44760,8.523334,53.58263,44580,8.522483,53.5898,44400,8.522567,53.59112,44280,8.522533,53.59085,43620,8.522883,53.59092,43440,8.522284,53.59075,43320,8.522284,53.5909,43200,8.521383,53.59117,43080,8.5212,53.5918,42840,8.518217,53.59378,42720,8.51505,53.59602,42540,8.510417,53.59882,42420,8.505867,53.60128,42240,8.500433,53.60448,42120,8.495417,53.60733,41940,8.4918,53.60952,41820,8.488767,53.61189,41640,8.485383,53.61402,41460,8.482333,53.61475,41340,8.4836,53.61475,41220,8.494333,53.61137,41040,8.503583,53.60425,40920,8.51295,53.5967,40800,8.51895,53.58893,40620,8.527817,53.58285,40500,8.5354,53.576,40380,8.542483,53.56947,40200,8.547967,53.56573,39300,8.548516,53.566,39180,8.549467,53.56222,39000,8.553333,53.55777,38820,8.560117,53.55225,37920,8.560483,53.55318,36600,8.56055,53.55325,35220,8.560583,53.55335,33960,8.560583,53.55333,32760,8.560583,53.55333,31440,8.56055,53.55338,30120,8.560516,53.5533,28860,8.56055,53.55337,27540,8.560634,53.55332,26160,8.560534,53.55335,26040,8.5603,53.55228,25920,8.552116,53.55437,25680,8.542666,53.56365,25560,8.53755,53.57082,25320,8.537817,53.57493,24000,8.536883,53.57492,23760,8.535033,53.57467,23640,8.533466,53.57512,23460,8.531716,53.57642,23340,8.531116,53.57757,23160,8.532084,53.57948,23040,8.530334,53.58178,22800,8.526883,53.58397,22680,8.523533,53.58722,22560,8.519917,53.59042,22320,8.513317,53.5959,22200,8.507466,53.60062,22080,8.501416,53.60515,21900,8.494133,53.61028,21720,8.498134,53.6083,21600,8.505667,53.60288,21420,8.512283,53.59801,21300,8.5181,53.59265,21180,8.523084,53.58805,21000,8.52865,53.58323,20880,8.53395,53.57782,20700,8.539184,53.57215,20580,8.544884,53.56652,20400,8.548266,53.56633,20220,8.548683,53.56375,20040,8.551683,53.55878,19920,8.555917,53.55433,19800,8.5604,53.55258,18480,8.560567,53.55342,17100,8.560634,53.5534,15840,8.560634,53.55343,14400,8.56075,53.55328,13140,8.56055,53.5534,11760,8.5605,53.55332,10440,8.560516,53.5532,9120,8.560583,53.55333,7860,8.560884,53.55332,6540,8.56075,53.55327,5220,8.560516,53.55335,3840,8.560683,53.55325,2520,8.560483,53.55343,1200,8.56065,53.55328]},{"name":"GEESTE","text":"GEESTE:Geeste can mean the following: Geeste is a municipality in the district Emsland in Lower Saxony.It is also a river in northwestern Germany, running through Lower Saxony and Bremen. It is the most downstream tributary of the River Weser and joins it near Bremerhaven. The Geeste rises in Hipstedt (Geestequelle - literally \"Geeste springs\") in the district of Rotenburg (Wümme) ten kilometres west of Bremervörde and drains a large part of the old district of Wesermünde (now Cuxhaven). Despite its name, only the upper reaches of the Geeste flow through geest, the rest flows through marshland. The navigable length of the Geeste is 25 kilometres and is the westernmost section of the Elbe-Weser Shipping Channel. The Geeste forms wide meanders in its lower reaches and, in the area of Bremerhaven there are still three river bends of the original five. Just before the mouth of the Geeste is a storm surge barrier beneath the Kennedy Bridge, which was completed in 1961 – just in time for the North Sea flood of 1962. Without the barrier part of Bremerhaven would have been flooded 'from behind' over the low dykes of the Geeste. An estimate of the flood damage which would have been caused if the Geeste barrier in Bremerhaven owned/built by EGA Essen had failed projected the number of inhabitants who would have been affected as 10,860 at a cost of about 1,837 million euros and probable flood damage of about 247 million euros. This roughly 250 million euros would probably not have been covered by insurance because the flooding would have been a consequence of a storm surge, which counts as an act of God. Until the merger of the district of Wesermünde in 1932, the Geeste formed the boundary between the districts of Lehe and Geestemünde.\n","path":[82260,8.56675,53.54657,80940,8.56675,53.54655,79620,8.566767,53.54653,78300,8.566767,53.54652,76920,8.566767,53.54652,75600,8.566767,53.54653,74220,8.56675,53.54653,72840,8.56675,53.54653,71460,8.566733,53.54655,70080,8.566733,53.54653,68760,8.56675,53.54652,67440,8.566716,53.54653,66120,8.566733,53.54653,64740,8.56675,53.54652,63360,8.566733,53.54652,62100,8.566733,53.54652,60780,8.56675,53.54653,59400,8.566733,53.54652,58020,8.566733,53.54652,56700,8.56675,53.5465,55440,8.56675,53.54652,54120,8.56675,53.54653,52800,8.566733,53.54652,51420,8.56675,53.54652,50100,8.56675,53.54652,48780,8.566767,53.54652,47520,8.566733,53.54653,46260,8.5667,53.54653,46020,8.56075,53.54762,45840,8.553433,53.55112,45720,8.55015,53.55463,45540,8.5471,53.55825,45420,8.543517,53.5616,45240,8.539866,53.56505,45060,8.5357,53.57003,44940,8.532333,53.5741,44760,8.528767,53.57788,44640,8.52585,53.58208,44400,8.524083,53.5878,43380,8.523967,53.58965,43260,8.5235,53.58977,42960,8.52185,53.59128,42780,8.518766,53.59365,42660,8.515683,53.59577,42480,8.511133,53.59862,42360,8.505366,53.60202,42180,8.500767,53.60478,42060,8.496384,53.60738,41880,8.492817,53.6095,41760,8.4892,53.61152,41640,8.49125,53.60937,41460,8.4972,53.6089,41340,8.50115,53.60667,41160,8.507067,53.60403,40620,8.50975,53.60115,40440,8.513634,53.59818,40260,8.518483,53.5944,40080,8.520534,53.59223,39840,8.522866,53.58983,39600,8.525683,53.58735,39360,8.526816,53.58672,37920,8.526484,53.5864,37800,8.525817,53.58638,37680,8.525217,53.58647,37440,8.522583,53.58863,37320,8.5193,53.5912,37140,8.515634,53.59393,36960,8.511833,53.59649,36840,8.507733,53.5991,36660,8.503583,53.60192,36540,8.499017,53.60337,36420,8.4995,53.60197,36120,8.502483,53.60069,35940,8.505883,53.59805,35820,8.509533,53.5951,35640,8.512567,53.59172,35520,8.51525,53.58852,35400,8.517333,53.58675,35220,8.524016,53.58373,35100,8.530084,53.58085,34860,8.535633,53.57555,34740,8.53995,53.57188,34620,8.543533,53.56825,34500,8.547383,53.56513,34260,8.548417,53.56735,34080,8.54905,53.56437,33900,8.5511,53.55932,33780,8.555483,53.55472,33600,8.5599,53.55053,33480,8.564934,53.54628,33360,8.569134,53.54495,32040,8.569034,53.54482,31860,8.566783,53.54613,30900,8.56675,53.54652,29580,8.566716,53.54653,28200,8.566733,53.54653,26880,8.566716,53.54653,25620,8.566716,53.54653,24300,8.566733,53.54652,22980,8.5667,53.54652,21660,8.5667,53.54652,20340,8.566716,53.54652,19020,8.5667,53.5465,18840,8.563583,53.54842,18720,8.559116,53.55377,18480,8.559134,53.55705,18240,8.559517,53.557,17040,8.559116,53.55702,15720,8.559167,53.55723,15540,8.559733,53.55955,15420,8.56055,53.56357,15180,8.560817,53.56438,14760,8.5608,53.56418,14640,8.560416,53.56422,14520,8.560284,53.56345,14400,8.5596,53.56205,14220,8.5596,53.55955,13920,8.559283,53.55684,12840,8.559,53.5568,11520,8.559116,53.55675,11340,8.559216,53.55639,11100,8.558867,53.55453,10860,8.556533,53.55343,10740,8.55425,53.55465,10620,8.55185,53.55672,10500,8.548966,53.55925,10320,8.546133,53.56197,10200,8.5432,53.56472,10080,8.540317,53.56733,9840,8.53605,53.57178,9720,8.532284,53.5757,9600,8.5301,53.5784,9480,8.53215,53.58048,8820,8.533067,53.57973,8700,8.533433,53.57885,8580,8.53425,53.57753,8460,8.53655,53.57553,8280,8.538383,53.57345,8160,8.541,53.57077,7980,8.544084,53.568,7860,8.546667,53.56562,7740,8.5486,53.56667,7380,8.548467,53.56743,7140,8.5487,53.56536,7020,8.549434,53.56247,6840,8.55225,53.5583,6720,8.55555,53.555,6540,8.559134,53.55127,6360,8.565367,53.54697,6060,8.566733,53.54652,4800,8.566733,53.54653,3420,8.56675,53.54655,2100,8.566716,53.54653,720,8.566716,53.54655]},{"name":"SIRIUS","text":"SIRIUS:Sirius Satellite Radio is a satellite radio (SDARS) and online radio service operating in North America, owned by Sirius XM Holdings.Headquartered in New York City, with smaller studios in Los Angeles and Memphis, Sirius was officially launched on July 1, 2002, and currently provides 69 streams (channels) of music and 65 streams of sports, news and entertainment to listeners. Music streams on Sirius carry a wide variety of genres, broadcasting 24 hours daily, commercial-free, and uncensored. A subset of Sirius music channels is included as part of the Dish Network satellite television service. Sirius channels are identified by Nielsen Audio with the label \"SR\" (e.g. \"SR120\", \"SR9\", \"SR17\").Its business model is to provide pay-for-service radio, analogous to the business model for premium cable television. Music channels are presented without commercials while talk channels, such as Howard Stern's Howard 100 and Howard 101 and Opie Radio do have regular commercials. Furthermore, all channels are free from FCC content regulation, thus songs are played unedited for language, and talk programs may feature explicit content if they wish. Subscriptions are prepaid and range in price from US$14.99 monthly (US$9.99 for each additional receiver) to US$699.99 for lifetime (of the receiver equipment[3]) subscription. There is a US$15 activation fee for every radio activated. Sirius announced it had achieved its first positive cash flow quarter for the period ending December 2006.[4]Sirius launched its radio service in four states on February 14, 2002, expanding service to the rest of the contiguous U.S. by July of that year. On October 16, 2006, Sirius announced that it would be launching Sirius Internet Radio, with 78 of its 135 channels being available worldwide on the internet to any of its subscribers with a valid user name and password.On July 29, 2008, Sirius formally completed its merger with former competitor XM Satellite Radio. The combined company began operating under the name Sirius XM Radio.[5] On November 12, 2008, Sirius and XM began broadcasting with their new, combined channel lineups.[6]As of Q1 2013, Sirius XM has a total of 24.4 million subscribers.[7]On April 11, 2016 Sirius XM announced crossing the 30 million subscriber threshold on the Howard Stern Show.Sirius was founded by Martine Rothblatt, David Margolese and Robert Briskman.[8][9][10] In 1990, Martine Rothblatt founded Satellite CD Radio, Inc. in Washington, DC.[8][11] The company was the first to petition the FCC to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast, which “provoked a furor among owners of both large and small [terrestrial] radio stations.”[11] Rothblatt had previously helped create the PanAmSat international satellite television system,[12] and helped launch and served as CEO of the Geostar satellite navigation system.[8][13] In April 1992, she resigned as chairman and CEO of Sirius in order to start a medical research foundation, focused on finding a cure for her daughter's illness.[8] Former NASA engineer Robert Briskman, who designed the company's satellite technology, was then appointed Chairman and CEO.[14][15]Six months later, in November 1992, Rogers Wireless co-founder David Margolese, who had provided financial backing for the venture, acquired control of the company and succeeded Briskman. Margolese renamed the company CD Radio, and spent the next five years lobbying the FCC to allow satellite radio to be deployed, and the following five years raising $1.6 billion, which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from Kazakhstan in July 2000.[15][16][17][18] The company successfully bid $83.3 million to purchase their satellite radio license.[19] In 1997, after Margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and \"effectively created the industry,\" the FCC also sold a license to XM Satellite Radio, which followed Sirius's example.[20]In November 1999, Marketing chief Ira Bahr convinced Margolese to again change the name of the company, this time to Sirius Satellite Radio, in order to avoid association with the soon-to-be-outdated CD technology.[9] Having secured installation deals with automakers including Chrysler, Ford and BMW,[18] Sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on February 14, 2002,[21] expanding to the rest of the contiguous United States on July 1, 2002.[22] In 2001 Margolese stepped down as CEO, remaining as chairman until November 2003, with Sirius issuing a statement thanking him \"for his great vision, leadership and dedication in creating both Sirius and the satellite radio industry.\"[23]Joe Clayton, former CEO of Global Crossing, followed as CEO from November 2001 until November 2004. Clayton stayed on as chairman until July 2008.[24] Mel Karmazin, former president of Viacom, became CEO in November 2004, and remained in that position through the merger, until December 2012.[25][26]On February 19, 2007, Sirius announced a merger deal with XM Satellite Radio.[27] Upon government approval, the merger combined the two radio services and created a single satellite radio network in the United States, named Sirius XM Radio.[28]On March 24, 2008, the United States Justice Department approved the merger of Sirius and XM.[29] Approval from the FCC cleared on July 25, 2008.[30] Conditions of the merger included allowing any third-party company to make satellite radio devices; producing new radios that can receive both XM and Sirius channels within one year; allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have; freezing subscription rates for three years; setting aside 8% of its channels for noncommercial programmers; and payment of $19.7 million in fines for past rule violations.[30]According to a Spring 2007 Arbitron report, the five most listened to channels on Sirius based on their Average Quarterly Hour (AQH) Share were Howard 100, Howard 101, The Highway (60), Sirius Hits 1 and Octane (37).[31]On October 6, 2004, Sirius announced that it signed a five-year, US$100 million per year agreement with Howard Stern to move his radio show, The Howard Stern Show, to Sirius starting on January 9, 2006.[32] The deal, which gave Sirius exclusive rights to Stern's radio show, also gave Stern the right to build three full-time programming channels. Since his announcement in 2004, the audience grew almost tenfold by the end of his second year on Sirius, from less than 700k to 6 million subscribers (see graph on the right).Currently, Stern has two operating channels on Sirius, but still retains the right to a third. Stern said his move was forced by the stringent regulations of the FCC whose enforcement was intensified following the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. Beginning with the announcement of his imminent departure, Stern complained Infinity Broadcasting was making his departure more acrimonious than was necessary.A major component of Sirius' business strategy has been to execute far-reaching and exclusive deals with big-name entertainers and personalities to create and build broadcast streams from the ground up. Sirius has reached extensive deals with Howard Stern, domestic diva Martha Stewart, E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt (aka Little Steven), Jimmy Buffett, and Eminem to executive-produce streams or entire channels on Sirius. Van Zandt was the first major musician recruited by Sirius or XM to create branded music channels, and he has created two distinct stations for Sirius: the Underground Garage, dedicated to garage rock, and Outlaw Country with its focus on alternative country music.Sirius presents an extensive array of programming on multiple channels that cover a wide variety of genres. The overall categories include: Music, News/Talk, Sports, and Entertainment. Within each category there are multiple channels that present a wide variety of subgenres. For example, the Music category subdivides into streams for Rock, Pop, Country, Hip-Hop/R&B, Jazz/Blues – and within each stream there are channels for various subsections. An example of the variety of music offerings available would be the 22 channels offering different subgenres of rock.The vast majority of its programming is self-produced exclusively for Sirius. However, there are some shows—especially in the Talk genre—that are syndicated programs originally created for terrestrial radio that now air on traditional radio and Sirius simultaneously—for example, the Eternal Word Television Network.Among the hosts who present shows heard on Sirius there are many high-profile personalities:On November 18, 2004, the former COO and President of Viacom, Mel Karmazin, was named CEO of Sirius. Howard Stern worked under Karmazin at Infinity Radio, and the two appeared to always hold a great deal of mutual respect. It was Karmazin who fiercely defended Stern in the wake of the Super Bowl XXXVIII Halftime Show (produced by MTV and aired by CBS, both co-owned with Infinity—now CBS Radio—until CBS Corporation split off in 2006) and the FCC crackdown on shock jocks and obscenity in general.Another cornerstone of Sirius’ business strategy has been to pursue exclusive sports content. Currently, Sirius has exclusive satellite radio broadcasting rights to all NFL, CFL and NBA games. Sirius also announced in December 2005 a multi-year deal with the NBA, which made the satellite radio company the broadcaster of more live NBA games than any other radio outlet. Sirius airs Full Court Press, weekdays from 12 pm – 3 pm ET; FCP is the only all-NBA show on Sirius. The agreement also created a 24-hour NBA Radio Channel, which was located on channel 127. However, as of November 12, 2008, NBA games have switched to XM and are therefore now part of Sirius as part of the \"Best of XM\" package and the 24-hour NBA channel no longer airs, replaced by Sporting News Radio. NHL games were shared with XM for the 2005–2006 season, and XM now holds exclusive rights. Sirius currently has full NASCAR coverage, including, among other programs, a two-hour weekly show hosted by NASCAR driver Tony Stewart. In 2009, for the first time, it carried live coverage of the Le Mans 24-hour race from Radio Le Mans.Sirius also has rights to a number of major college sports teams, including teams in the Big East, Big Ten and Southeastern Conferences as well as The University of Notre Dame. Beginning in 2005 Sirius also has exclusive radio rights to cover the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In August 2004, Sirius launched Sirius NFL Radio, a 24-hour radio stream dedicated exclusively to covering the NFL. Sirius has also been aggressive in creating its own in-house produced studio sports radio content.Sirius also has the only national Horse racing talk show, At the Races, hosted by noted racing handicapper, Steve Byk. The show which airs weekdays between 4 and 7, is unique in the horseracing world.The Hardcore Poker Show, Wednesday night at 8 p.m. (eastern), hosted by Rob Pizzo and Chris Tessaro, is the only syndicated poker talk show in North America.Sirius also broadcasts select Premier League matches which generally air on Saturday and Sunday Mornings during the season, but there are occasional games on weekday afternoons. Continuing their major expansion of soccer coverage, Sirius announced a deal to add UEFA Champions League soccer to their lineup on September 27, 2006. As of recently Sirius also had exclusive radio rights to broadcast the ESPN television feed of the Euro 2008 championships. Rounding out their coverage Sirius also airs a two-hour soccer talk show on Wednesday nights on channel 125 called \"The Football Show\" with former Metrostars GM Charlie Stillitano and former International Italian star Giorgio Chinaglia. The show also airs on Tuesday evenings after UEFA Champions League Matches. On Saturdays and Sundays during premier league season, Sirius airs Radio 606, a classic radio call in show from the UK discussing all of the days top matches.On September 15[year needed], Chris Russo launched his own show called Mad Dog Unleashed.Even after the merger between Sirius and XM was completed, Major League Baseball games remained exclusive to XM Radio as a result of an arrangement dispute between MLB and Sirius XM, which prevented Sirius subscribers from listening to games.[citation needed] However, on August 19, 2013, Sirius XM reached an agreement with MLB allowing all customers with both Sirius and XM receivers to hear the games with a premium subscription.[32]In August 2003, Sirius partnered with Clearwater, Florida-based Applied Media Technologies Corporation, a provider of telephone \"on hold\" messaging.[33] AMTC provides Sirius service in a package branded as Sirius Music for Business. For US$29.95 per month, AMTC provides all of Sirius' streams of commercial-free music, and pays all performance royalties to ASCAP, Broadcast Music Incorporated, and SESAC, so that business owners may legally play Sirius' music in their establishments.Unlike the music services Muzak / DMX Music or Music Choice, the SiriusXM for Business service uses the same channels and SDARS delivery platform as the consumer Sirius service. The SDARS delivery platform, on the other hand, is more reliable than any of the other services in that it is not subject to satellite dish rain fade. The highly elliptical orbit of the Sirius satellite constellation can pose difficulties for the reliable delivery of the signal to stationary antennas in certain parts of the country. To eliminate this potential problem, Sirius launched a new geostationary satellite, FM-5, to improve service to non-mobile customers such as those of SiriusXM for Business.[34] The service can also be accessed online using Sirius' online streaming technology, allowing any business with a broadband Internet connection to overcome any potential reception issues. Additionally, Sirius is applying for repeaters in Hawaii and Alaska and has already been granted authority for 20 repeaters covering the island of Puerto Rico by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).In March 2007, Sirius announced the upcoming availability of its first video service called \"Backseat TV\". In August 2007, the company revealed details of the first receiver, the SVC1, was originally offered exclusively through Chrysler OEM factory units. The service includes streaming video from three \"family\" television channels: Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network Mobile. There will be a single screen (or a dual screen option in the Chrysler Town and Country and Dodge Grand Caravan) for back seat passengers to watch while front seat passengers have the option of simultaneously listening to any normal Sirius radio channel. The service is reported to cost an additional US$6.99 per month on top of the standard Sirius subscription price.[35][36] The MSRP of the factory installed units is US$470 and the aftermarket unit has an MSRP of US$299.99. Both were made available in the fourth quarter of 2007.[37] As of 1 January 2016 the service has been discontinued.In June 2005, Sirius signed an agreement with BBC Radio 1 in the UK to rebroadcast the station to an American audience. In August 2011 Sirius abruptly dropped BBC Radio 1 leading to thousands of angry customers, as evidenced by the facebook groups that soon emerged.[38]Sirius also has exclusive satellite radio rights to National Public Radio, carrying two separate streams (whereas XM's XM Public Radio channel carries only programming not produced by NPR, such as by PRI). The deal with NPR was the first high-profile deal entered into by Sirius. The Sirius NPR NOW (now available on XM) programming does not include the popular programs All Things Considered and Morning Edition.[39]With the launch of Sirius Canada in December 2005, American listeners gained five Canadian-produced stations including CBC Radio One, CBC Radio Three and Iceberg Radio, and Première Plus, Énergie2, and Bande à part for French listeners. Iceberg Radio is programmed by Standard Broadcasting, which also provides a number of additional channels exclusive to Canada; the other four come from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. After a delay and outcry from Canadian subscribers, Sirius Canada added Howard Stern's Channel 100 to their lineup in early 2006. Channel 101, Stern's other channel (featuring Bubba the Love Sponge, Scott Ferrall, and other personalities), were made available in late June 2006.Talk radio content recently added onto Sirius Satellite Radio include the ABC News and Talk channel 143 (since having ceased operations), including live feeds of Sean Hannity and Larry Elder's syndicated radio shows, Patriot Talk channel 125 (which includes Michael Reagan's syndicated radio show) and Fox News Talk channel 145 (which includes syndicated radio hosts such as Alan Colmes and John Gibson).On March 14, 2006, Sirius added Cosmo Radio, Playboy Radio, and returned the audio simulcast of the Fox News Channel TV feed, which was previously removed during a contract dispute. The service also added Fox's satellite talk radio channel, Fox News Talk.In April 2003 Sirius launched Sirius OutQ, the first ever 24/7 talk channel designed for the LGBT audience. Personalities associated with the channel include Frank DeCaro, Michelangelo Signorile, Derek Hartley, and Romaine Patterson.In addition to the audio programming, the Sirius broadcast stream also carries a Data Services channel that is utilized by capable receivers and graphical display hardware. Some of the data services offered are traffic speed and flow, marine weather, and fuel prices to name just a few. Examples of capable hardware are the Raymarine SR100 Satellite Weather receiver and the Alpine NVE-N872A Satellite Traffic Ready navigation system.The Sirius signal is separated into three carriers, one each for the two satellites, and the third for the terrestrial repeater network where available. Sirius receivers decode all three 4 MHz carrier signals at once to achieve signal diversity. This is in contrast to XM which uses six carriers and decodes three 2 MHz carriers to economize on receiver power consumption and complexity at the cost of channel-changing speed. There is an intentional four-second delay between the two satellite carrier signals. This enables the receiver to maintain a large buffer of the audio stream, which, along with forward error correction, helps keep the audio playing in the event that the signal is temporarily lost, such as when driving under an overpass or otherwise losing line-of-sight of any of the satellites or ground repeater stations.A third, separate signal is uplinked to the AMC-6 Ku-band satellite and received by 36-inch (910 mm) satellite dishes for the ground repeater network. This third signal is broadcast on a third segment of the signal.The technology for Sirius Satellite Radio receivers as well as some of the uplink equipment, and the studio encoder, originated at Bell Labs in the late 1990s and subsequent years. The studio encoder was a result of Bell Labs efforts in statistical multiplexing of perceptual audio coded signals, a cousin of the MP3 standards. The waveform design for the terrestrial and satellite signals, as well as the early prototype receivers, were implemented in a FPGA logic and tested in the field to verify the performance of the receivers. This work was contracted by Sirius to Lucent Technologies, at the time a spinoff of AT&T. Early prototypes were followed by a number of generations of ASIC custom designed chipsets, supplied at first by Agere Systems and later supplied by Agere Systems and their competitor ST microelectronics.Three signals from three different sources (satellite, satellite, and terrestrial) are therefore combined in the receiver as radio signals, (not as audio signals). The three signals need to be combined constructively (avoiding situations where bad signals pollute good signals) in the receiver before being decoded. Heavy error correction is applied to the signals. All three signals contain the same audio content on all the channels that the receiver can receive, with the exception of one audio program waveform being transmitted ahead of the other two by approximately four seconds. With this time skew, the signals, once realigned, need to see an 8-second obstruction of overpass fade in order to lose audio content. This increases the robustness of the signal delivery in most driving conditions.In order to recover meaningful signal and error free audio from a signal impaired by interference and fading, the receiver uses concatenated Reed-Solomon block coding and Forward Error Correction encoding and decoding (codec). This technique was proven in the early days of satellite modems in the late 1970s. Linkabit, then run by Irwin Jacobs prior to his involvement with Qualcomm, offered such a codec for rack mounting in satellite earth stations. The Sirius signal uses more robust error correction on control channels than on the audio content, trading off error correction and bandwidth differently for separate categories of bits in the signal waveform.The terrestrial carrier is an OFDM QPSK signal, cousin to WiMax and LTE, with the particular feature that more than one transmitter operates on the same frequency, forming a single frequency network. A number of transmitters can be placed around a city to create coverage that is less subject to fading than if a single transmitter were used. The satellite signal is QPSK. Both satellite and terrestrial signals have hierarchical modulation superposed on the original signal, a measure created to add bandwidth at a small expense in the satellite link budget for decoding the core audio content.This architecture has worked remarkably well in avoiding drop out of audio signal when driving under highway overpasses, and when scintillating (very deep and frequent losses in signal strength caused by radio fading from trees) conditions exist. Since Sirius and XM separately entered the market with incompatible waveforms on the satellite, one would logically conclude that the merged company will eventually evolve the signal format again to take advantage of their size, but this is a speculative statement. The use of satellite and terrestrial combined service has been adopted by the DVB-SH standard, and companies such as ICO communications who cooperated with Alcatel-Lucent on system design and field trials. ONDAS, a Madrid-based company, also adopted this pioneering system architecture.The receiver is designed to mitigate and retain signal quality in hostile signal conditions and the relatively weak signal levels from distant satellites. Because the satellites are not all geostationary they appear and disappear over the horizon. Terrestrial signals are present only in major cities to augment the satellite signals.Approximately five chipset versions were built by Agere and approximately 4 versions were built by STMicroelectronics after the initial prototypes, although all of the early receivers included an Agere chipset known as Northstar. This platform enjoyed the highest volume of chipsets to date, representing the bulk of total production from 2002 to 2010. As of 2010, most of the chipsets are produced by STMicroelectronics.At the heart of a Sirius receiver is a custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip called the Baseband Integrated Circuit currently the STA240, which is produced by STMicroelectronics. The chip contains embedded ARM7TDMI and ARM946E-S microprocessors synthesized from IP cores. Every baseband has a unique Electronic Serial Number (or Sirius ID). Another major section of a Sirius receiver is the tuner. The tuner is also a custom ASIC, the STA210. The tuner connects to the antenna, and receives the incoming satellite and terrestrial signals at 2.315 GHz and downconverts them to intermediate frequency signals at around 75 MHz. The strength of the signals is approximately −50dBm in clear-sky conditions. The IF signals are fed to the STA240, which are digitized, demodulated, error-corrected, de-interleaved, and decrypted using specialized circuits on the chip. The baseband processor utilizes a 16 MB SDRAM memory to buffer four seconds of one of the satellite signals in order to bring it into time coincidence with the other for Maximal-ratio combining. On newer receivers with a \"pause\" feature, a dual-port PSRAM is employed to store up to 60 minutes of the selected channel. The baseband processor outputs digital audio over a Serial Peripheral Interface, which is fed to a D/A converter to produce the analog audio signal. The front-end of a Sirius receiver is called the head unit, required to display descriptive text (such as the category, channel, artist, and song name) and provide controls to the user. This is implemented by the third-party designers of Sirius-ready receivers, using a microprocessor of their choice.Sirius offers car radios and home entertainment systems, as well as car and home kits for portable use. The Sirius receiver includes the antenna module and the receiver module. The antenna module picks up signals from the ground repeaters or the satellite, amplifies the signal and filters out any interference. The signal is then passed on to the receiver module. Inside the receiver module is a chipset consisting of eight chips. The chipset converts the signals from 2.3 gigahertz (GHz) to a lower intermediate frequency. Sirius also offers an adapter that allows conventional car radios to receive satellite signals.Sirius broadcasts using 12.5 MHz of the S band between 2320 and 2332.5 MHz. Audio channels are digitally compressed using a proprietary variant of Lucent's Perceptual audio coder compression algorithm and encrypted with a proprietary conditional access system. Sirius has announced that they intend to implement hierarchical modulation technology to economize on bandwidth up to 25%.[40]Each receiver must be connected to an external antenna, which is included with the receiver. Antenna placement is crucial to receiving a clear signal. In some locations users have experienced difficulty receiving the Sirius programming because the signal is not consistently strong. For best reception, antennas should be placed such that they have an unobstructed view of the sky (preferably on rooftops without overhanging eaves or trees). If this is not an option, the antenna should be placed on an exterior wall. When placing on an exterior wall, the antenna should be mounted to a wall which faces the center of the continental United States in order to minimize the likelihood of the building itself blocking the signal.[41][42]Sirius' satellites are named Radiosat because there is already a fleet of satellites named Sirius, launched by Sweden's NSAB (Nordiska Satellitaktiebolaget, or Nordic Satellite AB, and known today as SES Sirius) and used for general telecommunications and satellite television throughout Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia.The current primary uplink facility for Sirius, which was formerly used as the uplink site for Western Union's Westar fleet of communication satellites from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, is located in Glenwood, New Jersey. The original facility was located on the roof of the building housing the Sirius studios in Rockefeller Center in New York City but has since been decommissioned.Sirius' spacecraft Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 4 were manufactured by Space Systems/Loral. The first three of the series were orbited in 2000 by Proton-K Block-DM3 launch vehicles, with the final three-satellite constellation completed on November 30, 2000. Radiosat 4, built as a ground spare, was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in October 2012.[43] It is on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The satellites are based on the Space Systems/Loral 1300 platform. All three satellites broadcast directly to the consumer's receiver, but due to the highly elliptical orbit only two of them broadcast at any given time.Satellites Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 3 fly in geosynchronous (not geostationary) Tundra orbits. Like the geostationary orbit, the tundra orbit has a period of 23 hours, 56 minutes (one sidereal day). Unlike the geostationary orbit, the tundra orbit is elliptical, not circular, and is inclined with respect to the equator rather than orbiting directly over it. The eccentric orbit ensures that each satellite spends about 16 hours of each day high over the continental United States. At least one satellite is always visible, with another often visible as well. The orbit's high inclination places apogee just west of Hudson Bay in Canada, providing a much higher elevation angle for most of the country than is possible from a geostationary orbit. This reduces blockage from tall buildings in urban areas, allowing a much smaller terrestrial repeater network than does sister network XM, which uses geostationary orbits.On June 8, 2006, Space Systems/Loral announced that it was awarded a contract for the fifth Sirius spacecraft.[44] The new spacecraft features a nine-meter unfurlable reflector. The first four Sirius spacecraft used more traditional parabolic reflectors. The new satellite has been designed for geostationary orbit, unlike the other satellites in the constellation; the different orbit has the stated purpose of allowing for more consistent reception for fixed location users (many subscribers have reported having to regularly reposition their antennas for optimal reception). Radiosat 5 (FM-5) is in a geostationary orbit at 96 degrees west. It was launched June 30, 2009, and announced to be in service as of September 9, 2009.[45]On October 14, 2010, the XM-5 satellite was launched aboard an International Launch Services (ILS) Proton vehicle. It was placed into geostationary orbit at 85.2 degrees west to serve the eastern half of the United States. The satellite was manufactured by Space Systems/Loral and was fully operational on December 3, 2010.[46]On February 29, 2008, the launch service provider International Launch Services announced a contract which includes launch of the SIRIUS FM-6 satellite on a Proton Breeze M rocket.[47] The launch planned for March 6, 2012, was canceled due to concerns with a design defect in the solar panel deployment.[48] The Radiosat 6 (FM-6) satellite was launched on October 25, 2013, and will be put in a geostationary orbit around 115 degrees west which would service the western half of the United States.[49]As of 2005[update], Sirius receivers were available for various new Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, Jaguar, Jeep, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mercury, MINI, Mitsubishi, Scion, Toyota (except Corolla), Porsche, Volkswagen, and Volvo vehicles, and the service plans on adding availability for portable use. Subaru offers Sirius on the Forester and Impreza. Starting in 2006, all Rolls-Royce vehicles sold in the United States came with a Sirius radio and lifetime subscription as standard equipment. Sirius had an exclusive contract for VW and Audi vehicles from 2007 through 2012, and with Kia Motors from 2008 through 2014, with an optional extension to 2017. Beginning in the 2007 model year, Bentley vehicles have had Sirius as an option, and it became standard equipment in several models beginning in 2008.[50] Porsche switched to XM Satellite Radio on their vehicles beginning with the 2007 model year. Currently, only Toyota (including its Lexus and Scion divisions) and Subaru offer both Sirius and XM contracts (however both companies usually equip vehicles with XM).Sirius also makes several receivers for aftermarket installations such as the Sportster4, Starmate Replay, Sirius S50 with built in 1 GB MP3 player, and the Sirius One. Radios from Sirius include:For an additional fee, Sirius subscribers are also able to access all of the proprietary music channels and most of the talk stations via streaming media through Sirius.com. A standard 64 kbit/s and \"Premium\" 128 kbit/s feed are available.Alternatives to the browser based player are available such as a Yahoo! Widget (designed to look like a miniature Sportster model receiver), and SIRIUS Internet Radio Player (based on Windows Media Player and available as plug-in or standalone application). Both alternatives are gaining popularity with streaming listeners, and offer artist and track name information updated in real time, which is an improvement from the online Sirius player.Recently, SiriusXMStream has come available as a replacement to Usirius. It offers a server capability to stream Sirius and XM programming to game consoles and mobile phones as an alternative to the iPhone And Blackberry app.NiceMac LLC, creator of the StarPlayr and StarLightXM product lines have created clients for Mac, PC, Windows Mobile and iPhone. The company recently merged with Jason Millard of Millard Software and plans to release uSirius StarPlayr, a Sirius XM iPhone client in 2009. [1]CatPig Studios Inc. has also released Radium for Mac, a general-purpose internet radio player that supports XM and Sirius. In early 2010, Rogue Amoeba software released Pulsar, a standalone Sirius-XM player for Mac OSX. [2]In addition to being available through Sirius.com, Howard Stern's website offers a Java application that streams the two Stern-themed channels. The site also states that Stern-specific video and audio clips will be made available at a later date.[52]Sirius XM has developed a software application for use on the Apple iPhone and Apple iPod Touch devices that allows its subscribers and users of those devices to listen to its programming. The application was released and available for download on the evening of June 17, 2009. The Sirius XM app is available at the iTunes App Store. Also integrated into the app is a \"click to buy\" function where if a user clicks any song title playing on Sirius XM they are given the option to be taken to the iTunes Music Store where they can purchase the track or album. Due to the terms of a new contract, the Howard Stern channels were added on Tuesday, December 21.Sirius XM has developed a streaming app for the Android Smartphone platform. This app is available free of charge in the market, and requires an additional US$3.49/mo to subscribe to. The app features all of the content available on a standard Sirius receiver.Sirius XM has also developed an application for use on certain 3G enabled Rim BlackBerry smartphones. Much like its iPhone and iPod Touch counterpart, it features a restricted 120 channel lineup featuring most of the music channels and selected talk programming. As with the iPhone app, some select programming, including MLB Play-by-Play, NFL Play-by-Play, SIRIUS NASCAR Radio are not available on the Blackberry. Shortly after signing a new contract, Howard Stern began promoting the mobile app, and his content was added to the mobile offerings.Blackberry smartphones currently compatible with the Sirius app:1 If OS version is above 5.0.239In November 2004, a partnership between Sirius, Standard Broadcasting and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation filed an application with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to introduce Sirius in Canada. The application was approved on June 16, 2005. The decision was appealed to the Canadian federal cabinet by a number of broadcasting, labour, and arts and culture organizations, including the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, CHUM Limited, and the National Campus and Community Radio Association. The groups objected to Sirius’ approach to and reduced levels of Canadian content and French language programming, along with the exclusion of Canadian non-commercial broadcasting. After a lengthy debate, cabinet rejected the appeals on September 9, 2005. Sirius Canada was officially launched December 1, 2005.In 2006 it offered a lifetime plan to subscribers that for a $549 fee it would unlock the top tier channels for unlimited consumption on any Sirius device, including the Internet and phone. However, the company currently only offers at maximum, a three-year subscription.[53]The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has reported poor reception in northern Canada.[54]In September 2009, The Federal Communications Commission agreed to Sirius XM's request for a special temporary authority to operate 20 terrestrial repeaters for the satellite radio service in Puerto Rico.The commission did so over the objections of the Puerto Rico Radio Broadcasters Association (Asociación de Radiodifusores de Puerto Rico), who said the approval in essence expands the Sirius XM footprint outside its authorized coverage area and that the satcaster would compete with terrestrial broadcasters for listeners.After receiving communications by public officials in opposition to the broadcasters, such as Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock, in rejecting those arguments, the commission said Sirius XM's footprint already covers the island but the signal is weak and blocked by tall buildings and foliage. As for the impact on competition, the FCC said it has considered these arguments before and \"declined to find that\" satellite radio would harm local broadcasters.The Sirius full terrestrial coverage is available in select sites in the cities of San Juan, Carolina, Bayamón, Cataño, Caguas and Ponce. In the rest of Puerto Rico, coverage is provided by Sirius' constellation of satellites.In October 2006, Sirius announced that it was launching a new service named Sirius Internet Radio (SIR) that offered approximately 75 of the 135 Sirius channels worldwide to people other than subscribers to its satellite radio service. Prior to this, Sirius subscribers who had a satellite radio were also able to access many of the Sirius channels via the Internet, using a special password, but the service operated at 32 kbit/s and was only available to those who purchased a satellite radio receiver. Sirius Internet Radio is an Internet-only subscription, allowing worldwide listeners to listen to the content without having to purchase a satellite radio receiver, the internet subscription can also be heard on Wi-Fi enabled Internet radio for consumer and business purposes such as those designed by Grace Digital. The service also expands the number of channels that are available to Sirius Stiletto 100 users via Wi-Fi.As of February 11, 2009, Sirius XM had $3.25 billion in total debt and had until February 17, 2009, to repay $175 million in bonds held by EchoStar. EchoStar has been buying Sirius XM's debt since an unsuccessful December 2008 takeover bid. Shares of Sirius XM had been trading for less than $1 from September 10, 2008, until February 2010.[55] The company announced in early February 2009 that it may file for bankruptcy \"as early as\" Tuesday, February 17, 2009.[56] On February 17, 2009, Sirius entered into an investment agreement with Liberty Media Corporation. Sirius received 550 million dollars to pay off maturing debt in exchange for 40% of its convertible preferred stock.","path":[45600,8.243112,53.73704,45360,8.259158,53.73053,45120,8.27398,53.72477,45000,8.28457,53.72085,44820,8.296231,53.7169,44640,8.310735,53.71199,44520,8.320748,53.70753,44340,8.331648,53.70261,44220,8.340442,53.69699,44040,8.348577,53.69124,43860,8.359087,53.68368,43740,8.36813,53.6772,43560,8.37662,53.67128,43440,8.384632,53.66577,43260,8.39307,53.65959,43140,8.401815,53.65362,43020,8.410565,53.6494,42840,8.420835,53.64504,42660,8.43283,53.63988,42540,8.442694,53.63568,42420,8.452229,53.63196,42180,8.466719,53.6258,42060,8.478044,53.62129,41940,8.48744,53.61686,41700,8.499182,53.60798,41580,8.506732,53.60113,41340,8.516807,53.59132,41220,8.522883,53.58401,41040,8.529578,53.5771,40920,8.537238,53.56948,40740,8.543787,53.56271,40620,8.55091,53.55582,40500,8.558478,53.54946,40260,8.567284,53.54018,40140,8.56858,53.53289,39900,8.560905,53.52436,39780,8.551008,53.51998,39600,8.542135,53.51917,38580,8.5407,53.51869,37320,8.540667,53.51871,36060,8.540644,53.51868,34800,8.54072,53.51869,33540,8.54068,53.51871,32280,8.540655,53.51867,31020,8.540662,53.5187,29760,8.54068,53.5187,28500,8.540617,53.51869,27240,8.540685,53.51871,25980,8.540648,53.51867,24720,8.540642,53.5187,23460,8.540691,53.51872,22020,8.540618,53.51872,20760,8.540625,53.51869,19500,8.540677,53.5187,18300,8.540677,53.51854,18000,8.542619,53.51782,17820,8.554383,53.52278,17700,8.562424,53.5274,17580,8.569932,53.53253,17340,8.577837,53.53419,17220,8.577728,53.53271,16380,8.577659,53.53169,16260,8.577512,53.5312,16080,8.577332,53.53014,15840,8.576375,53.52773,15720,8.57742,53.52716,15600,8.578013,53.52603,15300,8.57879,53.52427,14220,8.578649,53.52415,12960,8.578653,53.52403,11700,8.578582,53.52413,10440,8.578647,53.52415,9180,8.57857,53.52416,7920,8.578655,53.52419,6660,8.578611,53.52415,5400,8.57863,53.52417,4140,8.578627,53.52419,2880,8.57863,53.52416,1620,8.578622,53.52412,360,8.578625,53.52416]},{"name":"WILSON AMSTERDAM","text":"WILSON AMSTERDAM:A.

basis.","path":[81600,8.560162,53.55258,80160,8.56014,53.55256,78900,8.56015,53.55256,77640,8.56015,53.55256,76260,8.560155,53.55256,74880,8.560155,53.55255,73560,8.560155,53.55257,73440,8.560265,53.55247,73320,8.558953,53.55194,73140,8.552685,53.5542,73020,8.545482,53.56113,72900,8.53868,53.56767,72660,8.527785,53.57738,72540,8.521658,53.58427,72420,8.51594,53.59046,72180,8.505524,53.59909,72000,8.503616,53.60242,71700,8.50683,53.60033,71460,8.50884,53.60085,71340,8.51022,53.60058,71160,8.510612,53.60069,70860,8.509915,53.60123,70560,8.509745,53.60165,70260,8.510115,53.60086,69300,8.51112,53.60034,69120,8.511028,53.60027,68940,8.51252,53.59811,68760,8.516788,53.5949,68580,8.521232,53.59063,68340,8.526825,53.5847,68220,8.532242,53.57921,68040,8.537831,53.57322,67920,8.542537,53.568,67740,8.54707,53.56284,67620,8.551568,53.55812,67500,8.555556,53.55428,67260,8.56025,53.55249,66240,8.560157,53.55256,64920,8.56016,53.55254,63660,8.560157,53.55255,62340,8.560157,53.55254,61020,8.560143,53.55256,59580,8.560155,53.55255,58320,8.56014,53.55257,58200,8.560253,53.55255,57900,8.553971,53.55271,57780,8.547183,53.55877,57660,8.540822,53.5645,57480,8.534575,53.57101,57360,8.52879,53.57693,57180,8.523352,53.58313,57000,8.521381,53.58904,56880,8.52157,53.58843,56760,8.522114,53.58767,56640,8.520053,53.58756,56520,8.518538,53.58812,56340,8.519653,53.58888,56220,8.521668,53.58912,55560,8.523697,53.58927,55260,8.524223,53.5895,55080,8.524402,53.5895,54780,8.526486,53.58671,54600,8.529837,53.58307,54480,8.533055,53.57967,54300,8.535855,53.57669,54180,8.53957,53.57261,54000,8.544765,53.56651,53820,8.550181,53.56069,53700,8.555757,53.55511,53580,8.56055,53.5522,53400,8.560148,53.55253,52020,8.560165,53.55255,50820,8.560159,53.55256,49380,8.560182,53.55256,48000,8.560182,53.55255,46620,8.560172,53.55256,45300,8.560175,53.55257,43980,8.560162,53.55253,43740,8.554033,53.55228,43620,8.54817,53.55667,43440,8.544242,53.56155,43320,8.54011,53.56633,43140,8.535543,53.57138,42960,8.530751,53.57789,42840,8.532828,53.58013,42720,8.533135,53.58018,41880,8.533245,53.57966,41760,8.532888,53.57963,41580,8.532318,53.57971,41340,8.529988,53.5812,41160,8.527132,53.58352,40920,8.522754,53.58713,40800,8.519615,53.59027,40560,8.51495,53.59443,40440,8.511236,53.5968,40260,8.507647,53.5993,40140,8.504423,53.60146,39900,8.498868,53.60423,39780,8.498446,53.60415,39660,8.498558,53.60407,39420,8.503305,53.60432,39240,8.506832,53.60395,39120,8.507528,53.60308,38820,8.508939,53.60252,38700,8.508928,53.60261,38520,8.511933,53.59963,38280,8.516127,53.59577,38160,8.517041,53.59452,38040,8.520558,53.59009,37860,8.52527,53.58527,37740,8.531095,53.57978,37560,8.536393,53.5743,37440,8.541988,53.56797,37260,8.547763,53.56168,37080,8.553211,53.5558,36900,8.560387,53.55253,36480,8.560155,53.55255,35100,8.560143,53.55256,33720,8.560139,53.55255,32460,8.560142,53.55253,32340,8.560212,53.55252,32160,8.560725,53.54997,31920,8.566201,53.54708,31800,8.56524,53.54706,31680,8.559657,53.54753,31500,8.551878,53.55409,31380,8.544224,53.56147,31200,8.536855,53.56888,31020,8.528974,53.57621,30900,8.522567,53.58249,30780,8.517756,53.58857,30660,8.517437,53.59431,30420,8.51772,53.59542,30180,8.517047,53.59592,29520,8.517097,53.59595,28140,8.5167,53.59579,27840,8.515988,53.59545,27720,8.5158,53.59491,27600,8.516138,53.59425,27480,8.517016,53.59311,27360,8.51791,53.59211,27240,8.51867,53.59095,26940,8.519711,53.58806,26820,8.519778,53.58813,26700,8.519812,53.58829,26520,8.521254,53.59019,26400,8.520349,53.59206,26280,8.518786,53.59394,26100,8.515018,53.59566,25920,8.512035,53.59761,25740,8.507071,53.6006,25620,8.503518,53.60293,25500,8.499543,53.60589,25320,8.494542,53.60922,25140,8.488078,53.61403,25020,8.483737,53.61665,24840,8.480318,53.61939,24660,8.48426,53.61827,24360,8.48658,53.61742,24240,8.487318,53.61718,24060,8.488916,53.61585,23940,8.492933,53.61305,23700,8.501922,53.60627,23580,8.508278,53.60126,23400,8.51512,53.59613,23280,8.521925,53.59059,23100,8.526215,53.58639,22980,8.531145,53.58209,22860,8.534657,53.57678,22680,8.538212,53.57255,22560,8.541569,53.56889,22320,8.546146,53.56527,22200,8.548885,53.56708,21780,8.548482,53.56742,20460,8.548487,53.56741,19080,8.548507,53.56743,18900,8.5485,53.56577,18780,8.54075,53.56519,18600,8.533738,53.57188,18480,8.527331,53.57878,18300,8.522099,53.58492,18120,8.517848,53.59098,18000,8.520082,53.59037,17880,8.520099,53.59012,17640,8.516907,53.5902,17520,8.517009,53.59009,17400,8.518458,53.59058,17280,8.518739,53.59189,17100,8.517206,53.59406,16980,8.516505,53.59507,16860,8.517083,53.59517,16740,8.51726,53.59526,16440,8.517339,53.59523,16320,8.517834,53.59517,15540,8.518416,53.59564,15240,8.518394,53.59561,15060,8.51852,53.59552,14040,8.51851,53.59559,13860,8.515944,53.59691,13500,8.515565,53.59733,13320,8.51815,53.59336,13140,8.523258,53.58808,12960,8.528274,53.58283,12840,8.532935,53.57824,12660,8.537931,53.57351,12480,8.543368,53.56859,12300,8.549996,53.56166,12180,8.554083,53.55666,12000,8.558485,53.55286,11820,8.560153,53.55258,

CAROLE","text":"MSC CAROLE:A given name (also known as a personal name, first name, or forename) is a part of a person's full nomenclature. It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term given name refers to the fact that the name usually is bestowed upon a person, normally given to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family.[1] Regnal names and religious or monastic names are special types of given names, as they are given to adults upon them receiving a crown or entering a religious order and as such are replacing the original given name of those persons. Given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner in informal situations. In more formal situations the surname is more commonly used, unless it is necessary to distinguish between people with the same surname. The idioms \"on a first-name basis\" and \"being on first-name terms\" allude to the familiarity of addressing another by a given name.The order given name – family name, commonly known as the Western order, is used throughout most European countries and in countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by Western Europe (North and South America, North, East, Central and West India, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines). The order family name – given name, commonly known as the Eastern order, is primarily used in East Asia (for example in China, Japan, Korea, Malaysian Chinese, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam), as well as in Southern and North-Eastern parts of India, but also in Hungary. It is common in popular use also in Austria and Bavaria, but also in France, Belgium, Greece and Italy, possibly because of the influence of the bureaucratic use of putting the family name before the given name. In China and Korea, even part of the given name may be shared among all members of a given generation in a family and the family's extensions, to differentiate those generations from other generations.\nThe order \"given name - father's family name - mother's family name\" is commonly used in Spanish-speaking countries to acknowledge the families of both parents. Today the order can also be changed legally in Spain using \"given name - mother's family name - father's family name\".Under the common Western naming convention, people may have one or more forenames (either given or acquired). If more than one, there is usually a main forename (German: Rufname) for everyday use, and one or more supplementary forenames. Sometimes however two or more forenames may carry equal weight. There is no particular ordering rule for forenames – often the main forename is at the beginning, but other arrangements are quite common.Under the common Western naming convention, people may have one or more forenames (either given or acquired).

common.\n\n","path":[79200,8.513383,53.59962,77940,8.5134,53.59963,75960,8.5134,53.59967,73980,8.51305,53.59917,73860,8.51305,53.59885,73740,8.513083,53.59863,73560,8.515034,53.597,73380,8.517767,53.59369,73200,8.52075,53.59105,73080,8.52335,53.58745,72900,8.527034,53.5841,72780,8.528733,53.5812,72660,8.529984,53.57925,72540,8.530084,53.57803,72240,8.528684,53.57898,72060,8.529233,53.5799,71880,8.531217,53.58028,71700,8.533134,53.57965,71400,8.5337,53.57972,69960,8.5338,53.57969,68700,8.533783,53.57973,67440,8.5338,53.57967,66180,8.533867,53.57973,64740,8.53385,53.57977,63480,8.533633,53.57969,62220,8.534034,53.57963,60960,8.533867,53.57969,59700,8.53385,53.57969,58260,8.533733,53.57962,57000,8.533867,53.5798,55560,8.533834,53.57973,54300,8.533767,53.57973,53040,8.533916,53.57983,51780,8.53375,53.57975,50520,8.53375,53.5797,49260,8.53375,53.57972,48000,8.533834,53.57963,46740,8.533783,53.57973,45480,8.533834,53.57973,44220,8.533767,53.57963,42960,8.533816,53.57973,41700,8.533234,53.57957,41460,8.531767,53.58027,41340,8.53025,53.58135,41160,8.528417,53.58282,41040,8.525683,53.58503,40860,8.522634,53.58772,40740,8.51915,53.59122,40500,8.514,53.59535,40380,8.510433,53.59768,40200,8.506967,53.59998,40020,8.503616,53.60221,39900,8.49995,53.60497,39720,8.49505,53.60883,39600,8.4891,53.61252,39420,8.4792,53.61792,39300,8.468233,53.62298,39120,8.45565,53.62827,39000,8.443067,53.63363,38760,8.425484,53.641,38640,8.412717,53.64635,38400,8.396517,53.65458,38280,8.38725,53.66155,38160,8.377617,53.66908,37980,8.367884,53.67667,37860,8.357683,53.68345,37740,8.34695,53.69025,37560,8.33635,53.69708,37440,8.323667,53.7036,37320,8.310384,53.70863,37080,8.289516,53.71635,36960,8.277083,53.72087,36840,8.263233,53.72588,36660,8.250533,53.73048,36540,8.234567,53.73652,36360,8.220817,53.74168,36240,8.2085,53.74788,36060,8.1968,53.75467,35940,8.183333,53.7626,35760,8.17105,53.77023,35580,8.157933,53.78048,35460,8.148233,53.78815,35340,8.1399,53.795,35220,8.1311,53.8026,35100,8.122884,53.80962,34980,8.114384,53.81637,34800,8.10335,53.82295,34620,8.08625,53.8303,34440,8.0663,53.83645,34200,8.037017,53.84533,34020,8.02115,53.849,33900,8.005533,53.85093,33720,7.984217,53.8536,33540,7.966617,53.85588,33420,7.94605,53.85863,33300,7.931967,53.86055,33180,7.918016,53.86243,32940,7.896017,53.86514,32760,7.875517,53.8674,32640,7.861333,53.8678,32520,7.850717,53.8674,32400,7.841516,53.8671,32280,7.830917,53.869,32040,7.814167,53.87185,31920,7.79845,53.87482,31740,7.784367,53.87735,31740,7.784367,53.87735,31500,7.757333,53.88225,31380,7.742434,53.88413,31140,7.717417,53.88542,31020,7.703583,53.88717,30900,7.692934,53.88852,30660,7.676816,53.89058,30480,7.663167,53.89228,30300,7.64805,53.89412,30180,7.6374,53.89547,30000,7.625267,53.89693,29880,7.6147,53.89815,29700,7.602267,53.89967,29460,7.583683,53.90183,29340,7.572333,53.90273,29160,7.558267,53.90282,28980,7.545617,53.90282,28800,7.53135,53.9019,28620,7.517267,53.89973,28500,7.506567,53.89808,28320,7.494017,53.89623,28080,7.47385,53.8932,27840,7.45695,53.89046,27660,7.444567,53.88855,27540,7.432317,53.8866,27360,7.419767,53.88458,27180,7.405867,53.88237,27000,7.393533,53.88032,26520,7.352716,53.87443,26340,7.341833,53.87287,26100,7.321517,53.86997,25920,7.3058,53.8679,25740,7.291934,53.86647,25560,7.2789,53.86577,25380,7.2663,53.86523,25260,7.253533,53.86408,25140,7.244167,53.86275,24960,7.231616,53.8611,24780,7.21905,53.85943,24660,7.20655,53.85787,24480,7.193833,53.85627,24300,7.1813,53.85473,24120,7.167033,53.85307,23880,7.146317,53.85073,23700,7.133667,53.84972,23580,7.1206,53.84862,23400,7.107867,53.8476,23220,7.095133,53.84649,23040,7.08055,53.84527,22860,7.066033,53.84408,22740,7.053133,53.84307,22560,7.0403,53.84187,22380,7.027483,53.84089,22260,7.014433,53.83977,22080,7.001483,53.8387,21900,6.98815,53.8373,21780,6.976017,53.83562,21600,6.9618,53.83357,21420,6.9488,53.83187,21240,6.936033,53.82978,21120,6.9232,53.82777,20940,6.910367,53.82573,20760,6.897467,53.82362,20640,6.884617,53.8216,20460,6.871617,53.81945,20280,6.857683,53.81767,20160,6.8432,53.81558,20040,6.830033,53.81373,19860,6.814183,53.81142,19680,6.796916,53.8089,19560,6.777483,53.80603,19380,6.760433,53.8036,19200,6.739967,53.80067,19080,6.722683,53.79827,18960,6.70585,53.79576,18780,6.686783,53.79285,18660,6.669533,53.79032,18480,6.648366,53.7872,18300,6.6312,53.78478,18180,6.61395,53.78232,18060,6.598083,53.78015,17880,6.579417,53.77767,17760,6.562667,53.77543,17580,6.544034,53.77291,17400,6.523716,53.77033,13920,6.103467,53.70022,13740,6.0833,53.69645,13560,6.057883,53.69173,13380,6.034683,53.68747,13260,6.0165,53.68413,13080,6.00085,53.6812,12960,5.979033,53.67702,12660,5.9476,53.67112,12540,5.928067,53.66753,12360,5.908533,53.66385,12240,5.8896,53.66032,12060,5.870234,53.65655,11880,5.849916,53.65262,11760,5.82955,53.64878,11580,5.80775,53.64463,11400,5.787983,53.64088,11280,5.769267,53.6373,11160,5.753284,53.63427,11040,5.7382,53.63143,10800,5.715034,53.62703,10620,5.69155,53.62255,10440,5.668233,53.61803,10320

v Becker [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834 was a landmark family law decision of the Supreme Court of Canada. The Court established a new formulation of the constructive trust as a remedy for unjust enrichment based on the ideas of Professor Donovan Waters, and in particular the requirements for such constructive trust in a common law relationship separation. The Pettkus formulation of constructive trust was subsequently adopted elsewhere in the common law world.Rosa Becker and Lothar Pettkus, two immigrants to Canada, met in 1955. They moved in together and lived as husband and wife, although they did not marry, and they had no children. Until 1960, Becker paid the rent and living expenses from her outside income and Pettkus deposited his income in a bank account in his name. In 1961, they bought a farm in Quebec. The money came from Pettkus' account and ownership (\"title\") was taken out in his name, as was the custom in those days.\nThey shared the farm labour and both worked very hard. They turned their farm into a profitable bee-keeping operation. Becker also earned some income which was used for household expenses and to repair the farmhouse. Their savings went back into the farm or the Pettkus bank account. In 1971, with profits from the farm and more money from Pettkus' bank account, they purchased a property in Ontario and again registered it in his name. In 1972, Becker separated from Pettkus. He threw $3,000 on the floor and told her to take it, along with a car and forty beehives with bees. At his request, she moved back in with him three months later. She returned with the car, deposited $1,900 in his account, and the forty bee-hives without the bees. Shortly thereafter, with these returned assets, joint savings and proceeds from the sale of the Quebec land, they purchased another Ontario farm in Pettkus' name. They now had two valuable pieces of land, and in 1974 they moved and built a house upon one of them. They lived off their income from their thriving bee-keeping business. In the fall of that year, she left him for good, taking the car and $2,600 in cash.She also sued for a one-half interest in the properties, bee-keeping business and assets acquired through their joint efforts. Pettkus and Becker had lived together as husband and wife for almost twenty years. Under Ontario legislation at that time, a common law wife was not legally entitled to a share in any property owned by her husband. Therefore, any remedy for Becker would have to be based on the wholly equitable doctrine of constructive trust and principles of unjust enrichment.","path":[82740,9.87995,54.35683,82620,9.8711,54.3597,82440,9.860967,54.3623,82260,9.846133,54.36367,82020,9.83205,54.3636,81720,9.815316,54.36348,81600,9.805883,54.36327,81480,9.79905,54.36262,81300,9.79145,54.36106,81120,9.782483,54.358,81000,9.776,54.3549,80820,9.768833,54.3512,80700,9.76265,54.34808,80580,9.755834,54.34458,80340,9.745784,54.33958,80220,9.739217,54.33627,80040,9.732616,54.33302,79920,9.725634,54.32927,79740,9.71855,54.32512,79560,9.713866,54.3183,79440,9.712566,54.31188,79260,9.7112,54.30688,79140,9.70815,54.30272,78960,9.702633,54.2987,78840,9.6928,54.29548,78600,9.679617,54.29298,77880,9.64555,54.2856,77700,9.63635,54.27958,77580,9.631634,54.27405,77400,9.627934,54.26828,76920,9.62215,54.25827,76740,9.619483,54.25442,76560,9.616917,54.25023,76380,9.61375,54.24498,76200,9.611033,54.2405,76080,9.608167,54.23573,75900,9.604716,54.23027,75780,9.599617,54.22445,75600,9.593833,54.21955,71520,9.361033,54.14862,71340,9.351733,54.14542,71220,9.343384,54.14112,71040,9.33675,54.13598,70860,9.332434,54.13063,70740,9.329284,54.12506,70560,9.3282,54.11918,70380,9.328617,54.1133,70260,9.329416,54.10815,70080,9.32965,54.10238,69960,9.327983,54.0965,69780,9.32475,54.09013,69600,9.3218,54.08477,69480,9.31845,54.0786,69360,9.3165,54.0748,69180,9.313216,54.06863,69060,9.310866,54.06307,68820,9.308383,54.05655,68700,9.30655,54.05087,68520,9.304783,54.04436,68340,9.303233,54.03808,68160,9.301434,54.03102,67980,9.299617,54.0245,67800,9.29775,54.01745,67620,9.296184,54.01163,67440,9.294483,54.00557,67200,9.290916,53.99658,67020,9.286517,53.99014,66900,9.282033,53.9852,66720,9.276183,53.98048,66600,9.271167,53.97662,66420,9.265333,53.9724,66300,9.259817,53.96835,66120,9.253767,53.96408,66000,9.247517,53.95933,65760,9.23955,53.95363,65580,9.232433,53.94813,65400,9.2241,53.94215,65280,9.217533,53.93755,65040,9.20845,53.9308,64860,9.201533,53.92573,64740,9.19675,53.92238,64500,9.187467,53.91647,64320,9.180533,53.91255,64140,9.174983,53.90953,63960,9.17185,53.90782,63780,9.169184,53.90637,63660,9.166533,53.90497,63480,9.164617,53.90392,63300,9.161366,53.90211,63120,9.156934,53.8999,62940,9.151167,53.89732,62820,9.147034,53.89518,62580,9.145066,53.89405,61320,9.1451,53.89405,60060,9.144917,53.89398,59940,9.14395,53.89347,59820,9.1429,53.89292,59700,9.1408,53.8918,59520,9.13775,53.89013,59340,9.132317,53.88777,59160,9.12615,53.88633,59040,9.118484,53.88522,58920,9.111283,53.88415,58740,9.10525,53.88337,58620,9.10375,53.88323,58380,9.103967,53.88312,58200,9.1036,53.88295,57960,9.101733,53.88258,57780,9.0988,53.88208,57660,9.095034,53.8816,57420,9.08835,53.88032,57300,9.08305,53.8779,57120,9.0769,53.87518,56940,9.0663,53.86953,56760,9.05215,53.86485,56580,9.04,53.86122,56400,9.0209,53.85637,56280,9.002267,53.85347,56100,8.984716,53.85137,55920,8.966534,53.84903,55740,8.949833,53.84695,55500,8.921984,53.84283,55320,8.901217,53.84108,55140,8.88485,53.83968,54960,8.866083,53.8383,54780,8.84715,53.8378,54540,8.8206,53.83937,54420,8.803783,53.84052,54240,8.78705,53.84157,54120,8.773467,53.8445,53940,8.759883,53.85022,53760,8.74555,53.85665,53580,8.733216,53.86293,53460,8.7231,53.86918,53220,8.708167,53.8794,53040,8.697683,53.88965,52920,8.690166,53.89788,52740,8.680783,53.90803,52620,8.673083,53.9163,52440,8.6639,53.92622,52260,8.655867,53.93476,52020,8.636583,53.94738,51840,8.6183,53.95365,51660,8.602134,53.95775,51360,8.566183,53.96368,51180,8.547883,53.96605,51060,8.532217,53.96768,50880,8.513917,53.96955,50760,8.499583,53.97135,50520,8.476784,53.97415,50400,8.461717,53.97592,50160,8.437866,53.97818,50040,8.42325,53.9798,49920,8.41005,53.98145,49800,8.395317,53.98343,49680,8.382083,53.98487,49560,8.367416,53.98648,49320,8.344566,53.98893,49200,8.328867,53.9905,49020,8.312984,53.99205,48900,8.292566,53.9932,48780,8.277766,53.99332,48660,8.26265,53.99337,48540,8.247867,53.9933,48420,8.233017,53.99327,48300,8.218333,53.99325,48180,8.204083,53.99317,48000,8.189433,53.99308,47880,8.17485,53.99352,47760,8.166,53.99493,47580,8.152617,53.99255,47460,8.139967,53.99017,47340,8.126534,53.98763,47220,8.11175,53.98483,47040,8.0974,53.98215,46860,8.075733,53.97808,46740,8.0577,53.97467,46560,8.042867,53.97168,46380,8.02235,53.96755,46200,8.0011,53.96317,46020,7.98435,53.95433,45840,7.9686,53.9433,45720,7.957867,53.93565,45540,7.94415,53.92582,45360,7.931183,53.91623,45120,7.9101,53.90128,44460,7.878067,53.87012,44100,7.9141,53.86537,43980,7.937183,53.86228,43560,7.994783,53.85565,43320,8.024333,53.85087,43200,8.041083,53.84553,43020,8.061934,53.83927,42900,8.079967,53.83405,42660,8.107183,53.82347,41640,8.203883,53.75315,41520,8.215466,53.74648,41340,8.2392,53.73625,41100,8.26205,53.72763,40980,8.281883,53.72032,40800,8.3038,53.71288,40560,8.331317,53.7018,40440,8.34615,53.69233,40320,8.359233,53.68352,40080,8.3789,53.66948,39900,8.3925,53.6585,39780,8.4079,53.64928,39660,8.423833,53.64247,39540,8.4393,53.63582,39360,8.457233,53.62905,39240,8.473383,53.6232,39120,8.488334,53.61607,38880,8.503583,53.60448,38760,8.51125,53.5

- Indústrias Nacionais de Defesa, EP (Defense National Industries, Public Corporation) was a defense industry company owned by the Portuguese Government and created to replace the Fábrica Nacional de Munições de Armas Ligeiras (National Light Armament Ammunition Factory, FNMAL) and the Fábrica Militar do Braço de Prata (FMBP)[1] under the control of the National Defense Ministry.[2][3] However, these two companies never completely closed. They merged and continued to exist under the management of INDEP with the new names Fábrica Nacional de Munições (FNM) and Fábrica de Braço de Prata (FBP), respectively. The National Defense Ministry also never took complete control of INDEP and required authorization of the Finance Ministry.[4][5]On its creation, many of the products FNM and FBP made were branded and marketed under INDEP.In December 1996, a new reorganization of the Portuguese government-owned defense industries started and a new holding company, EMPORDEF, was created in March 1997.[6] The reduction of the national military manufacturing industry lead to the closing of all factories. INDEP was deactivated in December 2003 and closed for good in 2007.[5]","path":[81840,8.55075,53.57729,80580,8.550741,53.57726,79320,8.550722,53.57726,78060,8.550758,53.57725,76800,8.550715,53.57726,75540,8.550732,53.57727,74280,8.550743,53.57727,73020,8.550734,53.57725,71760,8.55074,53.57724,70500,8.550745,53.57727,69240,8.550722,53.57726,67980,8.550723,53.57727,66720,8.550808,53.57719,65460,8.550718,53.57725,64200,8.550712,53.57724,62760,8.550763,53.57724,61500,8.55076,53.57724,60240,8.550747,53.57721,58800,8.550698,53.57727,57540,8.550738,53.57725,56100,8.550683,53.57727,54480,8.550723,53.57723,53220,8.550736,53.57724,51780,8.550736,53.57725,50340,8.55071,53.57725,49080,8.550735,53.57723,47820,8.550725,53.57724,46440,8.550716,53.57728,45180,8.550675,53.57728,43860,8.550745,53.57721,43740,8.550736,53.57699,43560,8.550638,53.57632,43320,8.550473,53.574,43080,8.550081,53.57113,42960,8.549923,53.56983,42540,8.549925,53.56962,41280,8.54983,53.56956,41160,8.549809,53.56917,41040,8.549657,53.56836,40740,8.549272,53.56593,40500,8.549015,53.56339,40260,8.548598,53.56321,40140,8.546429,53.56441,39960,8.542385,53.56728,39840,8.538412,53.57082,39660,8.534277,53.5747,39540,8.530223,53.57845,39360,8.525732,53.58275,39180,8.520318,53.58788,39000,8.513962,53.59411,38880,8.507653,53.5992,38700,8.500172,53.60457,38580,8.491749,53.61057,38400,8.481695,53.61709,38220,8.465927,53.6244,38100,8.454062,53.62916,37980,8.441816,53.63416,37740,8.422963,53.64237,37620,8.408508,53.64848,37500,8.39724,53.65487,37320,8.386574,53.6621,37200,8.3758,53.66952,37080,8.365896,53.67636,36840,8.350475,53.68723,36720,8.340465,53.69401,36600,8.32999,53.70061,36420,8.316568,53.7058,36300,8.30093,53.71155,36120,8.285381,53.71739,36000,8.270534,53.72291,35760,8.249851,53.73087,35640,8.235353,53.73623,35460,8.222152,53.74117,35340,8.210257,53.74754,35160,8.198133,53.7548,35040,8.18487,53.7627,34920,8.17556,53.76869,34800,8.166113,53.77573,34680,8.158847,53.78124,34560,8.14979,53.78809,34380,8.135736,53.79901,34200,8.12527,53.80708,34020,8.112797,53.81657,33900,8.10158,53.82432,33780,8.088346,53.82936,33540,8.064925,53.83636,33420,8.051012,53.84057,33240,8.036272,53.845,33060,8.015213,53.85002,32880,7.990248,53.85301,32640,7.967285,53.85556,32400,7.936089,53.8594,32220,7.916928,53.86176,32100,7.90047,53.8639,31920,7.882828,53.86614,31860,7.874678,53.86718,31680,7.860599,53.86893,31500,7.845235,53.87065,31320,7.826963,53.87268,31140,7.81411,53.87537,30960,7.801683,53.87618,30840,7.787692,53.87705,30720,7.776665,53.87779,30600,7.766678,53.87852,30360,7.755552,53.87967,30180,7.751204,53.88014,30060,7.744882,53.88105,29820,7.730885,53.88288,29580,7.708199,53.8855,29460,7.690935,53.88749,29220,7.663503,53.89045,29100,7.64508,53.89274,28980,7.629173,53.89496,28800,7.612885,53.89647,28620,7.586353,53.89902,28440,7.564735,53.8991,28320,7.545882,53.89595,28200,7.528335,53.89277,27960,7.501542,53.88796,27840,7.484105,53.88482,27660,7.465887,53.88158,27540,7.446825,53.87825,27420,7.430063,53.87573,27240,7.411572,53.87295,27120,7.39298,53.87057,26940,7.37432,53.86841,26820,7.354247,53.86627,26700,7.336995,53.86473,26520,7.319843,53.86335,26340,7.29319,53.86111,26220,7.275038,53.85949,26040,7.255792,53.85744,25920,7.236447,53.85532,25800,7.219455,53.85343,25620,7.201372,53.8509,25500,7.184563,53.84894,25380,7.166543,53.84713,25200,7.14923,53.84541,25080,7.129734,53.84344,24960,7.111915,53.84161,24780,7.093245,53.8401,24660,7.075227,53.83871,24540,7.057981,53.83735,24420,7.04137,53.83607,24240,7.019442,53.83437,24060,7.00118,53.83271,23880,6.974397,53.83002,23760,6.955586,53.8281,23580,6.93687,53.82626,23460,6.918832,53.82441,23340,6.90171,53.82267,23220,6.883895,53.82084,22980,6.8575,53.81732,22860,6.839655,53.81495,22740,6.82252,53.81273,22560,6.803385,53.81016,22440,6.785692,53.80778,22320,6.768035,53.80544,22200,6.75469,53.80372,22080,6.736838,53.80138,21900,6.717906,53.79896,21780,6.699807,53.79655,21600,6.68108,53.79402,21480,6.66093,53.7913,21300,6.641642,53.78869,21180,6.623028,53.78629,21060,6.60591,53.78405,20880,6.587152,53.78163,20760,6.569038,53.77924,20640,6.550233,53.77677,20460,6.531538,53.77432,20340,6.513358,53.77191,20220,6.49627,53.76966,20100,6.478825,53.76737,19920,6.459291,53.76479,19800,6.440533,53.76227,19620,6.423247,53.76001,18060,6.21943,53.72733,17820,6.186753,53.7215,17640,6.163435,53.71741,17460,6.140079,53.71325,17340,6.122205,53.71006,17160,6.09979,53.70611,17040,6.084113,53.70343,16920,6.06798,53.70057,16800,6.050858,53.69765,16680,6.03531,53.69495,16500,6.017519,53.69191,16380,5.99907,53.68874,16260,5.983635,53.68613,16140,5.968071,53.68346,16020,5.951092,53.68052,15780,5.92347,53.6758,15600,5.900242,53.6718,15420,5.876982,53.66775,15300,5.86076,53.66496,15180,5.844298,53.66201,15060,5.827205,53.65873,14940,5.811769,53.65555,14820,5.79646,53.65201,14700,5.780408,53.64813,14580,5.765055,53.64439,14460,5.749717,53.64065,14280,5.732823,53.63647,14100,5.709965,53.63093,13920,5.686952,53.62527,13740,5.663985,53.61972,13560,5.640137,53.61396,13380,5.615582,53.60813,13260,5.599413,53.60438,13140,

OLIVER","text":"MSC OLIVER:The container ship MSC Oliver is one of the largest container vessels (as of May 2015) in the world, together with her sister ships MSC Oscar, MSC Zoe, MSC Maya and MSC Sveva. The vessel was delivered in March 2015 by Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (South Korea). According to the official statement of the CEO of Mediterranean Shipping Company, the ships are part from a bulk order for 20 vessels with same size, which will be used for cost optimizations of the company. With the new ships, the management of MSC are trying to fight the low freight rates and increased capacities of shipping.The ship is named Oliver after the CEO of MSC, Diego Aporte's nephew.[1]MSC Oliver and its sister ships were ordered by MSC in December 2013 and was completed in March 2015. The maiden voyage was planned for the beginning of April 2015 and the ship serves MSC's liner service between Asia and North Europe. MSC Oliver was built in Geoje shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (yard number 4278). The container ship is valued at worth of 140 million USD.MSC Oliver has an overall length of 395.40 m (1,297.2 ft), moulded[clarification needed] beam of 59 m (194 ft) and maximum summer[clarification needed] draft of 16 m (52 ft).[citation needed] The deadweight of the cargo ship is 196,000 DWT and the gross tonnage is 193,000 GT. The total capacity is 19,224 TEU and on board of the vessel there are 1,800 reefer points. According to its owner, the ship has better than 35% lower CO2 emissions per TEU than earlier container ships.[citation needed]The main engine of the container ship MSC Oliver is MAN B&W 11S90ME-C (10.2) with MCR of 62,500 kW at 82.2 rpm and NCR of 56,250 kW at 79.4 rpm. Such power is enough for the ship to reach service speed of 22.5 knots (42 km/h) and maximum speed of 25.0 knots (46 km/h). The optimized engineering and propulsion system decrease the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by over 35% per TEU compared to conventional ships of the company.[citation

It is currently in the G-cloud—a nearby accumulation of gas and dust known as an interstellar cloud.[12][13] Altair is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77 and is one of the vertices of the asterism known as the Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are marked by Deneb and Vega).[4][14][15] It is 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from the Sun and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye.[16]Altair rotates rapidly, with a velocity at the equator of approximately 286 km/s.[nb 2][6] This is a significant fraction of the star's estimated breakup speed of 400 km/s.[9] A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation.[17] Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon.[6]α Aquilae (Latinised to Alpha Aquilae) is the star's Bayer designation. The traditional name Altair has been used since medieval times. It is an abbreviation of the Arabic phrase النسر الطائر, al-nesr al-ṭā’ir (\"the flying eagle\"). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)[18] to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016[19] included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Altair for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.[20]Along with Beta Aquilae and Gamma Aquilae, Altair forms the well-known line of stars sometimes referred to as the Family of Aquila or Shaft of Aquila.[21]Altair is a type-A main sequence star with approximately 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and 11 times its luminosity.[6][7] Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours.[7] For comparison, the equator of the Sun requires a little more than 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.[6]Satellite measurements made in 1999 with the Wide Field Infrared Explorer showed that the brightness of Altair fluctuates slightly, varying by just a few thousandths of a magnitude with several different periods less than 2 hours.[5] As a result, it was identified in 2005 as a Delta Scuti variable star. Its light curve can be approximated by adding together a number of sine waves, with periods that range between 0.8 and 1.5 hours.[22] It is a weak source of coronal X-ray emission, with the most active sources of emission being located near the star's equator. This activity may be due to convection cells forming at the cooler equator.[9]The angular diameter of Altair was measured interferometrically by R. Hanbury Brown and his co-workers at Narrabri Observatory in the 1960s. They found a diameter of 3 milliarcseconds.[23] Although Hanbury Brown et al. realized that Altair would be rotationally flattened, they had insufficient data to experimentally observe its oblateness. Altair was later observed to be flattened by infrared interferometric measurements made by the Palomar Testbed Interferometer in 1999 and 2000. This work was published by G. T. van Belle, David R. Ciardi and their co-authors in 2001.[17]Theory predicts that, owing to Altair's rapid rotation, its surface gravity and effective temperature should be lower at the equator, making the equator less luminous than the poles. This phenomenon, known as gravity darkening or the von Zeipel effect, was confirmed for Altair by measurements made by the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer in 2001, and analyzed by Ohishi et al. (2004) and Peterson et al. (2006).[7][24] Also, A. Domiciano de Souza et al. (2005) verified gravity darkening using the measurements made by the Palomar and Navy interferometers, together with new measurements made by the VINCI instrument at the VLTI.[25]Altair is one of the few stars for which a direct image has been obtained.[26] In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his coworkers produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the Sun, had been imaged.[26] The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator.[6] The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.[9]The term Al Nesr Al Tair appeared in Al Achsasi al Mouakket's catalogue, which was translated into Latin as Vultur Volans.[27] This name was applied by the Arabs to the asterism of α, β, and γ Aquilae and probably goes back to the ancient Babylonians and Sumerians, who called α Aquilae the eagle star.[28] The spelling Atair has also been used.[29] Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe depicted Altair and Vega as birds.[30]The Koori people of Victoria also knew Altair as Bunjil, the wedge-tailed eagle, and β and γ Aquilae are his two wives the black swans. The people of the Murray River knew the star as Totyerguil.[31] The Murray River was formed when Totyerguil the hunter speared Otjout, a giant Murray cod, who, when wounded, churned a channel across southern Australia before entering the sky as the constellation Delphinus.[32]In Chinese, the asterism consisting of α, β, and γ Aquilae is known as Hé Gǔ (河鼓; lit. \"river drum\").[29] Altair is thus known as Hé Gǔ èr (河鼓二; lit. \"river drum two\", meaning the \"second star of the drum at the river\").[33] However, Altair is better known by its other names: Qiān Niú Xīng (牵牛星) or Niú Láng Xīng (牛郎星), translated as the cowherd star.[34][35] These names are an allusion to a love story, The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd, in which Niulang (represented by Altair) and his two children (represented by β and γ Aquilae) are separated from respectively their wife and mother Zhinu (represented by Vega) by the Milky Way. They are only permitted to meet once a year, when magpies form a bridge to allow them to cross the Milky Way.[35][36]The people of Micronesia called Altair as Mai-lapa, \"big/old breadfruit\", while the Māori people called this star as Poutu-te-rangi, \"pillar of heaven\".[37]In Western astrology, the star Altair was ill-omened, portending danger from reptiles.[29]Japan Airlines's Starjet 777-200 JA8983 was named Altair.Altair Airlines was a regional airline that operated out of Philadelphia from 1966 to 1982.The NASA Constellation Program announced Altair as the name of the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) on December 13, 2007.[38] The Russian-made Beriev Be-200 Altair seaplane is also named after the star.[39]The Altair 8800 was one of the first microcomputers intended for home use.Altair is the name of three United States navy ships: USS Altair (AD-11), USS Altair (AK-257) and USNS Altair (T-AKR-291).Altair is the name of a 1919 poem by Karle Wilson Baker.Three of them walk together- She is the fairest of three; And sweet as the heavenly weather She maketh the heart of me!\"[40]The bright primary star has the multiple star designation WDS 19508+0852A and has three faint visual companion stars, WDS 19508+0852B, C, and D. Component B is not physically close to A but merely appears close to it in the sky.[10]Coordinates:  19h 50m 46.9990s, +08° 52′ 05.959″","path":[82380,8.583145,53.52289,81120,8.583145,53.52289,79860,8.583145,53.52289,78600,8.583145,53.52289,77340,8.583145,53.52289,75900,8.583145,53.52289,74580,8.583145,53.52289,73140,8.583145,53.52289,71880,8.583145,53.52289,70260,8.583145,53.52289,68820,8.583145,53.52289,67560,8.583145,53.52289,65700,8.583145,53.52289,64260,8.583145,53.52289,62820,8.583145,53.52289,61560,8.583145,53.52289,60300,8.583145,53.52289,59040,8.583145,53.52289,57720,8.583145,53.52289,55920,8.583145,53.52289,54480,8.583145,53.52289,53040,8.583145,53.52289,51780,8.583145,53.52289,50520,8.583145,53.52289,49020,8.583145,53.52289,47580,8.583145,53.52289,46320,8.583145,53.52289,45060,8.583145,53.52289,43800,8.583145,53.52289,42540,8.583145,53.52289,41220,8.583145,53.52289,39780,8.583145,53.52289,38340,8.583145,53.52289,37080,8.583145,53.52289,35820,8.583145,53.52289,34560,8.583145,53.52289,33240,8.583145,53.52289,31800,8.583147,53.52289,30540,8.583147,53.52289,29280,8.583147,53.52289,28020,8.582648,53.52289,27720,8.580338,53.52341,27360,8.579987,53.52374,27180,8.578201,53.52653,27000,8.577805,53.52936,26820,8.578123,53.53153,25860,8.578292,53.53187,25740,8.578297,53.53237,25620,8.578323,53.5337,25380,8.575085,53.53549,25260,8.572158,53.53463,25020,8.567308,53.53698,24900,8.56116,53.54413,24780,8.55451,53.55114,24600,8.546793,53.55853,24480,8.540294,53.56502,24360,8.533505,53.57181,24180,8.52663,53.57869,24060,8.519448,53.58603,23880,8.512807,53.59303,23700,8.502048,53.60099,23580,8.493149,53.6077,23280,8.474591,53.61853,23160,8.463772,53.62355,23040,8.455532,53.62708,22920,8.445525,53.63124,22680,8.426607,53.63953,22440,8.411852,53.64624,22200,8.39203,53.65684,21840,8.373638,53.67022]},{"name":"MAERSK IOWA","text":"MAERSK IOWA: IOWA is an independent neo-noir film directed, written and starring Matt Farnsworth.

HAMBURG","text":"NORDIC HAMBURG:Nordic commonly refers to:Nordic countries, the northwestern European countries, including Scandinavia and Fennoscandia Scandinavia, a cultural, historical and ethno-linguistic region in northern Europe. A native of Northern Europe. Nordic or North Germanic languages.The Nordic countries or Nordics[1] are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \"The North\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands).The population of the Nordic countries are mainly Scandinavian or Finnish, with Greenlandic Inuit and the Sami people as minorities. Of today's native languages, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Faroese are Germanic languages. The non-Germanic languages spoken are Finnish, Greenlandic and several Sami languages. The main religion is Lutheran Christianity.The Nordic countries have much in common in their way of life, history, their use of Scandinavian languages and social structure. Politically, Nordic countries do not form a separate entity, but they co-operate in the Nordic Council. Especially in English, Scandinavia is sometimes used as a synonym for the Nordic countries, but that term more properly refers to the three monarchies of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Scandinavian Peninsula on the other hand covers mainland Norway and Sweden as well as the northernmost part of Finland.[2] At 3,425,804 square kilometers, the combined area of the Nordic countries would form the 7th-largest country in the world. Uninhabitable icecaps and glaciers comprise about half of this area, mostly in Greenland. In January 2013, the region had a population of around 26 million people. The Nordic countries cluster near the top in numerous metrics of national performance, including education, economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality of life, and human development.[3]Although the area is linguistically heterogeneous, with three unrelated language groups, the common linguistic heritage is one of the factors making up the Nordic identity. The North Germanic languages Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are considered mutually intelligible. These languages are taught in school throughout the Scandinavian countries. Swedish, for example, is a mandatory subject in Finnish schools, since Finland by law is a bilingual country. Danish is mandatory in Faroese and Greenlandic schools, as these insular states are a part of the Danish Realm (Rigsfællesskabet). Iceland also teaches Danish, since Iceland too was a part of the Danish Realm until 1918. Beside these and the insular Scandinavian languages Faroese and Icelandic, which are also North Germanic languages, there are the Finnic and Sami branches of the Uralic languages, spoken in Finland and in northern Norway, Sweden and Finland, respectively, and Greenlandic, an Eskimo–Aleut language, spoken in Greenland.The Nordic countries also share, more or less, the Nordic model of economy and social structure: market economy is combined with strong labour unions and a universalist welfare sector financed by heavy taxes. There is a high degree of income redistribution and little social

BREMEN","text":"MSC BREMEN:The City Municipality of Bremen (German: Stadtgemeinde Bremen, IPA: [ˈbʁeːmən] ( listen)) is a Hanseatic city in northwestern Germany, which belongs to the state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen (also called just \"Bremen\" for short). As a commercial and industrial city with a major port on the River Weser, Bremen is part of the Bremen/Oldenburg Metropolitan Region, with 2.4 million people. Bremen is the second most populous city in Northern Germany and eleventh in Germany.[3] Bremen is a major cultural and economic hub in the northern regions of Germany. Bremen is home to dozens of historical galleries and museums, ranging from historical sculptures to major art museums, such as the Übersee-Museum Bremen.[4] Bremen has a reputation as a working class city.[5] Along with this, Bremen is home to a large number of multinational companies and manufacturing centers. Companies headquartered in Bremen include the Hachez chocolate company and Vector Foiltec.[6] Four-time German football champions Werder Bremen are also based in the city.\nBremen is some 60 km (37 mi) south from the Weser mouth on the North Sea. With Bremerhaven right on the mouth the two comprise the state of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen (official German name: Freie Hansestadt Bremen).The marshes and moraines near Bremen have been settled since about 12,000 BC. Burial places and settlements in Bremen-Mahndorf and Bremen-Osterholz date back to the 7th century AD. Since The Renaissance, some scientists have believed that the entry Fabiranum or Phabiranon in Ptolemy's Fourth Map of Europe,[7] written in 150 AD, refers to Bremen. But Ptolemy gives geographic coordinates, and by these dates Phabiranon is situated northeast of the mouth of river Visurgis (Weser). At that time the Chauci lived in the area now called north-western Germany or Lower Saxony. By the end of the 3rd century, they had merged with the Saxons. During the Saxon Wars (772–804) the Saxons, led by Widukind, fought against the West Germanic Franks, the founders of the Carolingian Empire, and lost the war. Charlemagne, the King of the Franks, made a new law, the Lex Saxonum. This law stated that Saxons were not allowed to worship Odin (the god of the Saxons), but rather that they had to convert to Christianity on pain of death. This period was called the Christianisation. In 787 Willehad of Bremen was the first Bishop of Bremen. In 848 the archdiocese of Hamburg merged with the diocese of Bremen into Hamburg-Bremen Archdiocese, seated in Bremen, and in the following centuries the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen were the driving force behind the Christianisation of Northern Germany. In 888 Archbishop Rimbert, managed to get Kaiser Arnulf of Carinthia, the Carolingian King of East Francia, to grant Bremen the right to hold its own markets, to mint its own coins and make its own customs laws. The city's first stone walls were built in 1032. Around this time trade with Norway, England and the northern Netherlands began to grow, thus increasing the importance of the city.In 1186 the Bremian Prince-Archbishop Hartwig of Uthlede and his bailiff in Bremen confirmed—without generally waiving the prince-archiepiscopal overlordship over the city—the Gelnhausen Privilege, by which Frederick I Barbarossa granted the city considerable privileges. The city was recognised as a political entity with its own laws. Property within the municipal boundaries could not be subjected to feudal overlordship; this also applied to serfs who acquired property, if they managed to live in the city for a year and a day, after which they were to be regarded as free persons. Property was to be freely inherited without feudal claims for reversion to its original owner. This privilege laid the foundation for Bremen's later status of imperial immediacy (Free Imperial City). In fact, however, Bremen did not have complete independence from the Prince-Archbishops, in that there was no freedom of religion, and burghers were still forced to pay taxes to the Prince-Archbishops. Bremen played a double role; it participated in the Diets of the neighbouring Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen as part of the Bremian Estates and paid its share of taxes, at least when it had previously consented to this levy. Since the city was the major taxpayer, its consent was generally sought. In this way the city wielded fiscal and political power within the Prince-Archbishopric, while not allowing the Prince-Archbishopric to rule in the city against its consent. In 1260 Bremen joined the Hanseatic League.Advent of territorial power[edit]14th to 18th century: territories of the Free City of Bremen (red) and of the Archbishopric of Bremen (yellow); straits between lower Weser and Jadebusen. In 1350, the number of inhabitants reached 20,000. Around this time the Hansekogge (cog ship) became a unique product of Bremen.In 1362, representatives of Bremen rendered homage to Albert II, Prince-Archbishop of Bremen in Langwedel. In return, Albert confirmed the city's privileges and brokered a peace between the city and Gerhard III, Count of Hoya, who since 1358 had held some burghers of Bremen in captivity. The city had to bail them out. In 1365 an extra tax, levied to finance the ransom, caused an uprising among the burghers and artisans that was put down by the city council after much bloodshed. In 1366, Albert II tried to take advantage of the dispute between Bremen's city council and the guilds, whose members had expelled some city councillors from the city. When these councillors appealed to Albert II for help, many artisans and burghers regarded this as a treasonous act, fearing that this appeal to the prince would only provoke him to abolish the autonomy of the city.The fortified city maintained its own guards, not allowing soldiers of the Prince-Archbishop to enter it. The city reserved an extra very narrow gate, the so-called Bishop's Needle (Latin: Acus episcopi, first mentioned in 1274), for all clergy, including the Prince-Archbishop. The narrowness of the gate made it physically impossible for him to enter surrounded by his knights.Nevertheless, on the night of 29 May 1366, Albert's troops, helped by some burghers, invaded the city. Afterward, the city had to again render him homage; the Bremen Roland, symbol of the city's autonomy, was demolished; and a new city council was appointed. In return, the new council granted Albert a credit amounting to the then-enormous sum of 20,000 Bremen marks.But city councillors of the previous council, who had fled to the County of Oldenburg, gained the support of the counts and recaptured the city on June 27, 1366. The members of the intermediate council were regarded as traitors and beheaded, and the city de facto regained its autonomy. Thereupon, the city of Bremen, which had for a long time held an autonomous status, acted almost completely independent of the Prince-Archbishop. Albert failed to obtain control over the city of Bremen a second time, since he was always short of money and lacked the support of his family, the Welfs, who were preparing for and fighting the Lüneburg War of Succession (1370–88).By the end of the 1360s Bremen had provided credit to Albert II to finance his lavish lifestyle, and gained in return the fortress of Vörde along with the dues levied in its bailiwick as guarantee for the credit. In 1369 Bremen again lent money to Albert II against the collateral of his mint, which was from then on run by the city council, which took over his right to mint coins. In 1377 Bremen purchased from Duke Frederick I of Brunswick-Lüneburg many of the Prince-Archbishop's castles, which Albert had pledged as security for a loan to Frederick's predecessor. Thus Bremen gained a powerful position in the Prince-Archbishopric (ecclesiastical principality), in effect sidelining its actual ruler.The declining knightly family of Bederkesa had become deeply indebted,[8] and, having already sold many of their possessions, had even pawned half their say in the Bailiwick of Bederkesa (Amt Bederkesa) to the aspiring Mandelsloh family (a noble house, or Adelsgeschlecht). They lost the rest of their claims to the city of Bremen when in 1381 its troops prevented the three Mandelsloh brothers from lending them to Albert II as territorial power.[9] The Mandelslohs and other robber barons from the Prince-Bishopric of Verden and the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen ravaged burghers of the city of Bremen as well as inhabitants throughout the Prince-Archbishopric.In 1381 the city's troops successfully ended the brigandage and captured the Castle of Bederkesa and its bailiwick. Thus Bremen gained a foothold to uphold peace and order in its forecourt on the lower course of the Weser. In 1386 the city of Bremen became the liege lord of the noble families holding the estates of Altluneburg and Elmlohe, who had previously been vassals of the Knights of Bederkesa.In 1411 the jointly ruling dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg, Eric IV and his sons Eric V and John IV, pawned their share in the Bederkesa bailiwick and castle to the Senate of Bremen, including all \"they have in the jurisdictions in the Frisian Land of Wursten and in Lehe (Bremerhaven), which belongs to the aforementioned castle and Vogtei\".[10] Their share in jurisdiction, Vogtei (bailiwick) and castle had been acquired from the plague-stricken Knights of Bederkesa.[10] In 1421, Bremen acquired also the remaining half of the rights of the Bederkesa knights, including their remaining share in Bederkesa Castle.[9]In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown. In November 1654, after the Second Bremian War, Bremen had to cede Bederkesa and the settlement of Lehe to the Duchy of Bremen (Treaty of Stade, 1654). Bremen and the Reformation.When the Protestant Reformation swept through Northern Germany, St Peter's cathedral belonged to the cathedral immunity district (German: Domfreiheit; cf. also Liberty), an extraterritorial enclave of the neighbouring Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. In 1532, the cathedral chapter which was still Catholic at that time closed St Peter's after a mob consisting of Bremen's burghers had forcefully interrupted a Catholic Mass and prompted a pastor to hold a Lutheran service.In 1547, the chapter, which had in the meantime become predominantly Lutheran, appointed the Dutch Albert Rizaeus, called Hardenberg, as the first Cathedral pastor of Protestant affiliation. Rizaeus turned out to be a partisan of the Zwinglian understanding of the Lord's Supper, which was rejected by the then Lutheran majority of burghers, the city council, and chapter. So in 1561—after heated disputes—Rizaeus was dismissed and banned from the city and the cathedral again closed its doors.However, as a consequence of that controversy the majority of Bremen's burghers and city council adopted Calvinism by the 1590s, while the chapter, which was at the same time the body of secular government in the neighbouring Prince-Archbishopric, clung to Lutheranism. This antagonism between a Calvinistic majority and a Lutheran minority, though it had a powerful position in its immunity district (mediatised as part of the city in 1803), remained dominant until in 1873 the Calvinist and Lutheran congregations of Bremen were reconciled and founded a united administrative umbrella Bremen Protestant Church, which still exists today, comprising the bulk of Bremen's burghers.At the beginning of the 17th century, Bremen continued to play its double role, wielding fiscal and political power within the Prince-Archbishopric, but not allowing the Prince-Archbishopric

(/ˈæri.ɒn/; Greek: Ἀρίων) was a kitharode in ancient Greece, a Dionysiac poet credited with inventing the dithyramb: \"As a literary composition for chorus dithyramb was the creation of Arion of Corinth,\"[1] The islanders of Lesbos claimed him as their native son, but Arion found a patron in Periander, tyrant of Corinth. Although notable for his musical inventions, Arion is chiefly remembered for the fantastic myth of his kidnapping by pirates and miraculous rescue by dolphins, a folktale motif.[2] Herodotus (1,23) says \"Arion was second to none of the lyre-players in his time and was also the first man we know of to compose and name the dithyramb and teach it in Corinth\". However J.H. Sleeman observes of the dithyramb, or circular chorus, \"It is first mentioned by Archilochus (c 665 BC)… Arion flourished at least 50 years later… probably gave it a more artistic form, adding a chorus of 50 people, personating satyrs… who danced around an altar of Dionysus. He was doubtless the first to introduce the dithyramb into Corinth\".[3]Arion is also associated with the origins of tragedy: of Solon John the Deacon reports: “Arion of Methymna first introduced the drama [i.e. action] of tragedy, as Solon indicated in his poem entitled Elegies\".[4]According to Herodotus' account of the Lydian empire under the Mermnads,[5] Arion attended a musical competition in Sicily, which he won. On his return trip from Tarentum, avaricious sailors plotted to kill Arion and steal the rich prizes he carried home. Arion was given the choice of suicide with a proper burial on land, or being thrown in the sea to perish. Neither prospect appealed to Arion: as Robin Lane Fox observes, \"No Greek would swim out into the deep from a boat for pleasure.\"[6] He asked for permission to sing a last song to win time.Playing his kithara, Arion sang a praise to Apollo, the god of poetry, and his song attracted a number of dolphins around the ship. At the end of the song, Arion threw himself into the sea rather than be killed, but one of the dolphins saved his life and carried him to safety at the sanctuary of Poseidon at Cape Tainaron. When he reached land, being eager for his journey, he failed to return the dolphin to the sea and it perished there. He told his misfortunes to Periander, the Tyrant of Corinth, who ordered the dolphin to be buried, and monument raised to it. Shortly after, word came to Periander that the ship in which Arion had sailed had been brought to Corinth by a storm. He ordered the crew to be led before him, and inquired about Arion, but they replied that he had died and that they had buried him. The tyrant replied: \"Tomorrow you will swear to that at the Dolphin's Monument.\" Because of this he ordered them to be kept under guard, and instructed Arion to hide in the monument of the dolphin the next morning, attired as he was when he threw himself into the sea. When the tyrant had brought them there, and ordered them to swear by the departed spirit of the dolphin that Arion was dead, Arion came out of the monument. In amazement, wondering by what divinity he had been saved, they were silent. The tyrant ordered them to be crucified at the monument of the dolphin, but Apollo, because of Arion's skill with the kithara, placed him and the dolphin among the stars.[7] This dolphin was catasterised as the constellation Delphinus, by the blessing of Apollo.The story as Herodotus tells it was taken up in other literature.[8] Lucian of Samosata wittily imagined the dialogue between Poseidon and the very dolphin who bore Arion.[9]Augustine of Hippo[10] asserted that pagans \"believed in what they read in their own books\" and took Arion to be a historical individual. \"There is no historicity in this tale\", also according to Eunice Burr Stebbins,[11] and Arion and the dolphins are given as an example of \"a folkloristic motif especially associated with Apollo\" by Irad Malkin.[12] Yet there are many more or less reliable historical accounts from many periods of people being saved by dolphins. Erasmus instanced Arion as one of the traditional poet's topics that sound like historia rather than fabulae, though he misremembered that Augustine had taken the Arion story to be historical.[13]From what is told in ancient Greek scripts, Arion, although favored by Apollo, is the son of Poseidon and Ino.The episode may be seen as a doublet of the fate of Melicertes, where the leap into the sea was that of his mother, Ino. transformed into the \"white goddess\" Leucothea; Melicertes was carried more dead than alive to the shores where the Isthmian Games were celebrated in his honour, as he was transformed to the hero Palaimon, who was placated with a nocturnal chthonic rite, and the whose winners were crowned with a barren wreath of spruce.[14]Another parallel is the myth of Dionysus and the sailors, related in the Homeric Hymns: Tyrrhenian pirates try to lash the god to the mast, but the wood itself starts to sprout and the mast is entwined with ivy (like the god's thyrsus); the sailors leap into the sea and are transformed into dolphins. This is especially interesting because Arion is credited with the invention of the dithyramb, a dionysiac song.In light of the above parallels, Walter Burkert interprets the story as a significant development in the history of Dionysiac cult: \"Released from this gloomy background, the cheerful and liberating legend of the sixth century further developed the image of the dolphin-rider under the colors of the renewed cult of Dionysus.\".[15] C.

Bowra[16] tied the myth to the period following the expulsion from Corinth of the aristocratic Bacchiadae, who traced their descent from Dionysus: \"the cult of the god had to develop new and more democratic forms.\"[17]Stewart Flory[18] identified Herodotus' characteristic use of the episode in a historicising context as an example of what Flory calls his \"brave gestures\", a man faced with death performs with calm dignity some spirited but unnecessary gesture that demonstrates contempt for danger.","path":[82740,8.560928,53.55331,81420,8.560965,53.5533,80100,8.560971,53.5533,78780,8.560953,53.5533,77400,8.560977,53.5533,76020,8.560971,53.5533,74700,8.560937,53.5533,73440,8.560951,53.5533,72180,8.560975,53.55331,70860,8.560962,53.55327,69600,8.560965,53.55329,68400,8.5607,53.55338,67080,8.560951,53.55329,65760,8.560946,53.55327,64380,8.560905,53.55331,63120,8.560893,53.5533,61860,8.560965,53.55324,60540,8.560928,53.55324,59160,8.561007,53.55325,57900,8.560964,53.55328,56520,8.560938,53.55333,55200,8.561007,53.5533,53880,8.56101,53.5533,52560,8.561011,53.55331,51360,8.561013,53.55331,50040,8.560971,53.55328,48840,8.560931,53.55335,47520,8.56101,53.55329,46140,8.560965,53.55325,44820,8.561005,53.55328,43500,8.560962,53.55329,43320,8.55943,53.55239,43140,8.559542,53.55637,42120,8.559755,53.557,40860,8.559778,53.55708,40680,8.559448,53.55945,40200,8.55943,53.55971,40080,8.559522,53.55979,39840,8.561605,53.55672,38520,8.562464,53.5554,38400,8.563521,53.55493,38280,8.562952,53.55543,38160,8.561229,53.55784,37980,8.561272,53.55975,37800,8.55852,53.56036,37620,8.561916,53.55913,37140,8.562134,53.55827,36840,8.562112,53.55889,36720,8.561992,53.55964,36600,8.561916,53.56007,36480,8.562081,53.56031,36180,8.56138,53.56124,36060,8.560476,53.56099,35760,8.560146,53.56367,35640,8.560538,53.56491,35340,8.561495,53.56673,34140,8.561795,53.56721,34020,8.562008,53.56686,33780,8.56074,53.56479,33660,8.558824,53.56021,32220,8.558766,53.56103,32100,8.560349,53.56436,31980,8.559278,53.56072,31800,8.561782,53.55936,31680,8.561882,53.55632,31560,8.563702,53.55429,30360,8.563931,53.55426,28980,8.563487,53.5543,27660,8.563662,53.55432,26280,8.563508,53.55427,24900,8.563421,53.55433,23580,8.563585,53.55427,23460,8.564027,53.55393,23340,8.564732,53.55319,22800,8.564584,53.55307,22320,8.564462,53.55303,22200,8.564415,53.55355,22080,8.563335,53.55486,21900,8.562141,53.55635,21780,8.561276,53.55775,21660,8.561175,53.55899,21540,8.560462,53.55951,21240,8.559381,53.55773,20340,8.559693,53.55692,19080,8.55958,53.55687,18780,8.559397,53.55474,18420,8.55964,53.55419,18240,8.559308,53.55417,18000,8.55879,53.55273,17880,8.55821,53.55213,17760,8.557629,53.5528,17580,8.554089,53.55483,17460,8.551175,53.55674,17340,8.550907,53.55707,17160,8.55021,53.55762,16920,8.548074,53.55958,16740,8.54535,53.56219,16620,8.54213,53.56524,16440,8.537858,53.56934,16320,8.533457,53.57354,16140,8.528065,53.57844,16020,8.523693,53.58285,15840,8.51929,53.58757,15720,8.514798,53.59198,15480,8.506262,53.59822,15360,8.500553,53.60287,15180,8.493402,53.60917,15000,8.487238,53.61321,14820,8.478167,53.61827,14640,8.469958,53.62202,14520,8.461645,53.6255,14340,8.453245,53.62894,14220,8.44594,53.63186,14040,8.438427,53.63541,13920,8.43067,53.63841,13740,8.422771,53.64138,13620,8.415118,53.64487,13380,8.404799,53.64968,13200,8.396915,53.65465,12960,8.387577,53.66137,12780,8.379685,53.66712,12540,8.369945,53.67391,12300,8.361152,53.68011,3900,8.098984,53.87902,3720,8.090847,53.88161,3540,8.083658,53.88351,3420,8.07734,53.88479,3180,8.069003,53.88772,1440,8.045197,53.93615,1260,8.052013,53.93878,1140,8.0593,53.94076,1020,8.065177,53.94298,900,8.071908,53.94556,720,8.08153,53.94777,480,8.092035,53.95154,240,8.10335,53.9564,60,8.11324,53.95936]},{"name":"MUNKEBO MAERSK","text":"MUNKEBO MAERSK:Munkebo is a town in central Denmark, located in Kerteminde municipality, Region of Southern Denmark on the island of Funen.

JANINE","text":"WES JANINE:\"Janine\" (David Bowie song), a 1969 song by David Bowie. David Bowie is the second studio album by English musician David Bowie, released under that title by Philips in the UK, and as Man of Words/Man of Music by Mercury in the US, in November 1969. It was reissued in 1972 by RCA Records as Space Oddity (the title of the opening track, which had reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart). Space Oddity was the name used for CD releases of the album in 1984, 1990 and 1999, but it reverted to the original, eponymous title for the 2009 and 2015 reissues.Regarding its mix of folk, balladry and prog rock, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray have said, \"Some of it belonged in '67 and some of it in '72, but in 1969 it all seemed vastly incongruous. Basically, David Bowie can be viewed in retrospect as all that Bowie had been and a little of what he would become, all jumbled up and fighting for control...\"[5]The album came about after Bowie had made the transition from a cabaret/avant-garde-inspired musician to a hippie/folk-based sound and as such the album is a major turning point from his 1967 debut. \"Don't Sit Down\", an unlisted 40-second jam heard after the album's second song, was listed as an independent track on CD releases of the album in the 1990s, but the 2009 and 2015 reissues returned the song to its original status as a hidden piece. Released as a single in July 1969, \"Space Oddity\" was a largely acoustic number augmented by the eerie tones of the composer's Stylophone, a pocket electronic organ. The title and subject matter were inspired by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and introduced the character of Major Tom. The song dates back as early as February 1969. It was written for a promotional video named \"Love You till Tuesday\". The video's intent was to sell Bowie to a new label as he had been dropped from Deram Records in April 1968. He was urged by his manager Kenneth Pitt to record some new material and so \"Space Oddity \"was born. Some commentators have also seen the song as a metaphor for heroin use, citing the opening countdown as analogous to the drug's passage down the needle prior to the euphoric 'hit', and noting Bowie's admission of a \"silly flirtation with smack\" in 1968.[6] His 1980 hit \"Ashes to Ashes\" declared \"We know Major Tom's a junkie\".\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\" reflected a strong Bob Dylan influence,[7] with its harmonica, edgy guitar sound and snarling vocal. \"Letter to Hermione\" was a farewell ballad to Bowie's former girlfriend, Hermione Farthingale, who was also the subject of \"An Occasional Dream\",[5] a gentle folk tune reminiscent of the singer's 1967 debut album. \"God Knows I'm Good\", Bowie's observational tale of a shoplifter's plight, also recalled his earlier style.[5]\"Cygnet Committee\" has been called Bowie's \"first true masterpiece\".[8] Commonly regarded as the album track most indicative of the composer's future direction, its lead character is a messianic figure \"who breaks down barriers for his younger followers, but finds that he has only provided them with the means to reject and destroy him\".[5] Bowie himself described it at the time as a put down of hippies who seemed ready to follow any charismatic leader.[8] Another track cited as foreshadowing themes to which Bowie would return in the 1970s, in this case the fracturing of personality, was \"Janine\", which featured the words \"But if you took an axe to me, you'd kill another man not me at all\".[9]The Buddhism-influenced \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" was presented in a heavily expanded form compared to the original guitar-and-cello version on the B-side of the \"Space Oddity\" single; the album cut featured a 50-piece orchestra. (It is also said to be Mick Ronson's debut on a Bowie record, playing uncredited guitar and handclaps midway through the song.[9]) \"Memory of a Free Festival\" was Bowie's reminiscence of an arts festival he had organised in August 1969. Its drawn-out fade/chorus (\"The Sun Machine is coming down / And we're gonna have a party\") was compared to The Beatles' \"Hey Jude\";[10] the song has also been interpreted as a derisive comment on the counterculture it was ostensibly celebrating.[11] The background vocals for the crowd finale featured Bob Harris, his wife Sue, Tony Woollcott and Marc Bolan among other people.[12] In 1970 Bowie cut the tune in half for the A- and B-sides of a more rock-oriented version featuring the band that would accompany him on The Man Who Sold the World later that year: Mick Ronson, Tony Visconti and Mick Woodmansey – an embryonic form of Ziggy Stardust's Spiders From Mars.Held to be \"the first Bowie album proper\",[9] and his first deemed worthy by record companies of regular reissue, David Bowie featured a notable list of collaborators, including session players Herbie Flowers, Tim Renwick, Terry Cox, and Rick Wakeman, as well as cellist Paul Buckmaster, multi-instrumentalist and producer Tony Visconti, and bassist John Lodge (not to be confused with The Moody Blues' bassist of the same name). Before recording for the album commenced at Trident Studios, the song \"Space Oddity\" had been selected as the lead single based on an earlier demo.[6] Visconti saw it as a \"novelty record\" and passed the production responsibility for the song on to Gus Dudgeon.[9] However, Visconti produced all the remaining songs on the album. Tim Renwick, John 'Honk' Lodge, Mick Wayne and John Cambridge – all from the band 'Junior's Eyes' – featured on the album sessions and briefly served as Bowie's backing band for live appearances and on an October 1969 BBC Radio session.[13][14][15]Although the opening song had given Bowie a No. 5 hit in the UK earlier in the year, the remainder of the material bore little resemblance to it and the album was a commercial failure on its initial release, despite some decent reviews.[10] The New York Times, in a review published over a year after the album's release, praised the album, calling it, \"a complete, coherent and brilliant vision\".[16] On the other hand, Village Voice critic Robert Christgau considered this album, like his debut, to be \"overwrought excursions\".[17] However the

They were written in the Old Norse language, mainly in Iceland.[1]The texts are tales in prose which share some similarities with the epic, often with stanzas or whole poems in alliterative verse embedded in the text, of heroic deeds of days long gone, \"tales of worthy men,\" who were often Vikings, sometimes pagan, sometimes Christian. The tales are usually realistic, except legendary sagas, sagas of saints, sagas of bishops and translated or recomposed romances. They are sometimes romanticised and fantastic, but always dealing with human beings one can understand.[2]The term saga originates from the Norse saga (pl. sögur), and refers to (1) \"what is said, statement\" or (2) \"story, tale, history\". It is cognate with the English word saw (as in old saw), and the German Sage. Icelandic sagas are based on oral traditions and much research has focused on what is real and what is fiction within each tale. The accuracy of the sagas is often hotly disputed. Most of the manuscripts in which the sagas are preserved were taken to Denmark and Sweden in the 17th century, but later returned to Iceland. Classic sagas were composed in the 13th century. Scholars once believed that these sagas were transmitted orally from generation to generation until scribes wrote them down in the 13th century. However, most scholars now believe the sagas were conscious artistic creations, based on both oral and written tradition. A study focusing on the description of the items of clothing mentioned in the sagas concludes that the authors attempted to create a historic \"feel\" to the story, by dressing the characters in what was at the time thought to be \"old fashioned clothing\". However, this clothing is not contemporary with the events of the saga as it is a closer match to the clothing worn in the 12th century.[3] There are plenty of tales of kings (e.g. Heimskringla), everyday people (e.g. Bandamanna saga) and larger than life characters (e. g. Egils saga). The sagas describe a part of the history of some of the Nordic countries (e.g. the last chapter of Hervarar saga). The British Isles, northern France and North America are also mentioned. It was only recently (start of 20th century) that the tales of the voyages to North America (modern day Canada) were authenticated.[4]Most sagas of Icelanders take place in the period from 9th till 11th centuries, which is called söguöld (Age of the Sagas) in Icelandic history. The sagas of kings, bishops, contemporary sagas have their own time frame. Most were written down between 1190 and 1320, sometimes existing as oral traditions long before, others are pure fiction, and for some we do know the sources: the author of King Sverrir's saga had met

& Joy\" is a six-issue story arc from the comic book series Runaways (vol. 1), published in issues one through six in 2003 by Marvel Comics' imprint Tsunami, which was created to attract young readers. It was written by Brian K. Vaughan and illustrated by Adrian Alphona. While it was initially intended to be a six-part miniseries, the popularity of \"Pride & Joy\" and new ideas from writer Vaughan allowed Runaways to grow into a regular monthly Marvel title. \"Pride & Joy\" has subsequently won several comics awards, including the 2006 Harvey Award for Best Continuing or Limited Series. Although the Tsunami imprint was unsuccessful, \"Pride & Joy\" (and the series Runaways that continued it) was one of the very few Tsunami series to do well in sales and to continue being published. The story arc has been critically acclaimed for its simple story set in the typically complex Marvel Universe.[1] Vaughan is known for avoiding the clichés of the superhero genre, locating the group in Los Angeles rather than New York City, where most Marvel Comics superhero titles are set. In order to create an everyday setting and tone, Vaughan included various references to current popular culture, including television series, films, events and celebrities.The story arc's primary purpose was to introduce the main characters, six children who discover their parents are evil after seeing them murder a girl in a sacrificial ceremony. It centers upon the children's relationships with their parents as the children learn that they themselves have inherited their parents' powers. Once The Pride realizes their offspring have disappeared, they begin to use their considerable influence to track down their sons and daughters.[2][3] \"Pride & Joy\" sets up the main concept of the series, which involves children versus their parents.[4]\"Pride & Joy\" was launched in 2003 as a part of Marvel's Tsunami imprint, the goal of which was to attract new readers, particularly young readers and the manga audience. Marvel editorial staff agreed to it immediately,[5] prompting Wizard Magazine to name the series as \"one of the best original concept from Marvel in thirty years.\"[6] The imprint was unsuccessful, and \"Pride & Joy\" (and the series Runaways that continued it) was one of the very few series from that imprint to continue being published and to do well in sales.[7] Writer Brian K. Vaughan has claimed that he had only planned to create \"Pride & Joy\" to be set for six months (six issues), but because of the popularity of the series and new ideas from Vaughan, Marvel decided to continue issuing it on for a monthly basis.[8] The character of Catherine Wilder was originally designed to look like singer-songwriter Sade.[9]Several of the characters went through subsequent changes as well. In Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Karolina Dean was originally called Leslie, a name which would eventually be given to the character's mother. Her parents were originally real estate agents, as opposed to famous actors.[10] Molly was one of the few Runaways to actually keep the name she had in Brian K. Vaughan's original proposal; she is named after Vaughan's younger sister, Molly Hayes Vaughan, and was supposed to be thirteen years old instead of eleven.[10] However, in the original pitch for the series, Molly's parents were Hollywood actors; this would eventually become the cover story of Karolina's parents.[10] Also, Molly's sibling-like relationship with Chase was originally supposed to be with Gert. Nico Minoru was called Rachel Messina. Her parents were still magicians, but posed as wealthy antique dealers; this cover story was ultimately used for Gert's parents.[10] Nico's source of power was not originally going to be her mother's Staff, but Robert Minoru's spellbook.[10] Chase was originally called John,[10] and Gert was called Gertie. Originally, Gert was meant to give Molly the name \"Bruiser.\"[10]Plot In the first issue of \"Pride & Joy,\" a group of youths unite to fight against their parents, who they then learn are known as \"The Pride,\" a band of villains. At the end of the issue, the youths witness the murder of a girl at the hands of their parents.[11] In the middle of the night, they run away from home and attempt to bring their parents to justice.[12] In the process, the youths realize that they are all inheriting special abilities: Nico Minoru learns she is a witch;[13] Karolina Dean finds out she is an alien;[14] Chase Stein steals his father's futuristic gauntlets, \"the Fistigons\";[14] Gertrude Yorkes discovers that she has a telepathic link to a dinosaur hidden by her time-traveling parents;[14] Molly Hayes discovers she is a mutant with super strength;[15] and Alex Wilder, though having no supernatural powers, possesses a prodigal intellect and steals the mystical text that contains The Pride's secrets, becoming the leader of the group.[14] Using the book that contains The Pride's secrets, the youth agree amongst themselves to make up for their parent's sins by fighting crime.[16] Once The Pride realizes its

or Aremorica is the name given in ancient times to the part of Gaul between the Seine and Loire rivers, that includes the Brittany peninsula, extending inland to an indeterminate point and down the Atlantic coast.[1] The toponym is based on the Gaulish phrase are-mori \"on/at [the] sea\", made into the Gaulish place name Aremorica (*are-mor-ika ) \"Place by the Sea\". The suffix -ika was first used to create adjectival forms and then, names (see regions such as Pays d'Ouche from Utica and Perche from Pertica). The original designation was vague, including a large part of what became Normandy in the 10th century and, in some interpretations, the whole of the coast down to the Garonne river. Later, the term became restricted to Brittany.In Breton (which belongs to the Brythonic branch of the Insular Celtic languages, along with Welsh and Cornish), \"on [the] sea\" is war vor (Welsh ar fôr – \"f\" being voiced, as \"v\" is in English), though the older form arvor is used to refer to the coastal regions of Brittany, in contrast to argoad (ar \"on/at\", coad \"forest\" [Welsh ar goed (coed \"trees\")]) for the inland regions.[2] These cognate modern usages suggest that the Romans first contacted coastal people in the inland region and assumed that the regional name Aremorica referred to the whole area, both coastal and inland.Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History (4.17.105), claims that Armorica was the older name for Aquitania, stating Armorica's southern boundary extended to the Pyrenees. Taking into account the Gaulish origin of the name, this is perfectly correct and logical, as Aremorica is not a 'country name', but a word that describes a type of geographical region - a region that is by the sea. Pliny lists the following Celtic tribes as living in the area: the Aedui and Carnuteni as having treaties with Rome; the Meldi and Secusiani as having some measure of independence; and the Boii, Senones, Aulerci (both the Eburovices and Cenomani), the Parisii, Tricasses, Andicavi, Viducasses, Bodiocasses, Veneti, Coriosvelites, Diablinti, Rhedones, Turones, and the Atseui.Trade between Armorica and Britain, described by Diodorus Siculus and implied by Pliny[3] was long-established. Because, even after the campaign of Publius Crassus in 57 BC, continued resistance to Roman rule in Armorica was still being supported by Celtic aristocrats in Britain, Julius Caesar led two invasions of Britain in 55 and 54 in response. Some hint of the complicated cultural web that bound Armorica and the Britanniae (the \"Britains\" of Pliny) is given by Caesar when he describes Diviciacus of the Suessiones, as \"the most powerful ruler in the whole of Gaul, who had control not only over a large area of this region but also of Britain\"[4] Archaeological sites along the south coast of England, notably at Hengistbury Head, show connections with Armorica as far east as the Solent. This 'prehistoric' connection of Cornwall and Brittany set the stage for the link that continued into the medieval era. Still farther East, however, the typical Continental connections of the Britannic coast were with the lower Seine valley instead.Archeology has not yet been as enlightening in Iron-Age Armorica as the coinage, which has been surveyed by Philip de Jersey.[5]Under the Roman Empire, Armorica was administered as part of the province of Gallia Lugdunensis, which had its capital in Lugdunum, (modern day Lyon). When the Roman provinces were reorganized in the 4th century, Armorica (Tractus Armoricanus et Nervicanus) was placed under the second and third divisions of Lugdunensis. After the legions retreated from Britannia (407) the local elite there expelled the civilian magistrates in the following year; Armorica too rebelled in the 430s and again in the 440s, throwing out the ruling officials, as the Romano-Britons had done. At the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 a Roman coalition led by General Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic King Theodoric I clashed violently with the Hunnic alliance commanded by King Attila the Hun. Jordanes lists Aëtius' allies as including Armoricans and other Celtic or German tribes (Getica 36.191).The \"Armorican\" peninsula came to be settled with Britons from Britain during the poorly documented period of the 5th-7th centuries.[6] Even in distant Byzantium Procopius heard tales of migrations to the Frankish mainland from the island, largely legendary for him, of Brittia.[7] These settlers, whether refugees or not, made the presence felt of their coherent groups in the naming of the westernmost, Atlantic-facing provinces of Armorica, Cornouaille (\"Cornwall\") and Domnonea (\"Devon\").[8] These settlements are associated with leaders like Saints Samson of Dol and Pol Aurelian, among the \"founder saints\" of Brittany.The linguistic origins of Breton are clear: it is a Brythonic language descended from the Celtic British language, like Welsh and Cornish one of the Insular Celtic languages, brought by these migrating Britons. Still, questions of the relations between the Celtic cultures of Britain— Cornish and Welsh— and Celtic Breton are far from settled. Martin Henig (2003) suggests that in Armorica as in sub-Roman Britain,\"there was a fair amount of creation of identity in the migration period. We know that the mixed, but largely British and Frankish population of Kent repackaged themselves as 'Jutes', and the largely British populations in the lands east of Dumnonia (Devon and Cornwall) seem to have ended up as 'West Saxons'. In western Armorica the small elite which managed to impose an identity on the population happened to be British rather than 'Gallo-Roman' in origin, so they became Bretons. The process may have been essentially the same.\"[9]According to C.E.V. Nixon, the collapse of Roman power and the depredations of the Visigoths led Armorica to act \"like a magnet to peasants, coloni, slaves and the hard-pressed\" who deserted other Roman territories, further weakening them.[10]When Vikings or Northmen settled in the Cotentin peninsula and the lower Seine around Rouen in the ninth and early tenth centuries, and these regions came to be known as Normandy, the name Armorica fell out of use in the area. With western Armorica having already evolved into Brittany, the east was recast from a Frankish viewpoint as the Breton March under a Frankish marquis.The home village of the fictional comic-book hero Asterix was located in Armorica during the Roman Republic; there, \"indomitable Gauls\" hold out against Rome. This unnamed village was reported as having been discovered by archaeologists in a spoof article in the British The Independent newspaper on April Fool's Day, 1993.[11]North Armorica is mentioned in the first sentence of James Joyce's novel Finnegans Wake.Armorica is featured extensively in Bernard Cornwell's novel The Winter King where Ynys Trebes, later Mont Saint Michel is besieged and destroyed by the Franks.In The Farfarers, Before the Norse,[12] Farley Mowat speculated that Armorica was the origin of the Albans, who fled from Romans to Britain and Orkney, and later fled from

CLARISSA","text":"LADY CLARISSA:Clarissa, or, the History of a Young Lady is an epistolary novel by English writer Samuel Richardson, published in 1748. It tells the tragic story of a heroine whose quest for virtue is continually thwarted by her family and is regarded as one of the longest novels in the English language (based on estimated word count). It is generally regarded as Richardson's masterpiece.Plot summary[edit]\nClarissa Harlowe, the tragic heroine of Clarissa, is a beautiful and virtuous young lady whose family has become wealthy only recently and now desires to become part of the aristocracy. Their original plan was to concentrate the wealth and lands of the Harlowes into the possession of Clarissa's brother James Harlowe, whose wealth and political power will lead to his being granted a title. Clarissa's grandfather leaves her a substantial piece of property upon his death, and a new route to the nobility opens through Clarissa marrying Robert Lovelace, heir to an earldom. James's response is to provoke a duel with Lovelace, who is seen thereafter as the family's enemy. James also proposes that Clarissa marry Roger Solmes, who is willing to trade properties with James to concentrate James's holdings and speed his becoming Lord Harlowe. The family agrees and attempts to force Clarissa to marry Solmes, whom she finds physically disgusting as well as boorish.\n\nDesperate to remain free, she begins a correspondence with Lovelace. When her family's campaign to force her marriage reaches its height, Lovelace tricks her into eloping with him. Joseph Leman, the Harlowes' servant, shouts and makes noise so it may seem like the family has awoken and discovered that Clarissa and Lovelace are about to run away. Frightened of the possible aftermath, Clarissa leaves with Lovelace but becomes his prisoner for many months. She is kept at many lodgings and even a brothel, where the women are disguised as high-class ladies by Lovelace himself. She refuses to marry him on many occasions, longing to live by herself in peace. She eventually runs away but Lovelace finds her and tricks her into returning to the brothel. Lovelace intends to marry Clarissa to avenge her family's treatment of him and wants to possess her body as well as her mind. He believes if she loses her virtue, she will be forced to marry him on any terms. As he is more and more impressed by Clarissa, he finds it difficult to believe that virtuous women do not exist.\n\nThe pressure he finds himself under, combined with his growing passion for Clarissa, drives him to extremes and eventually he rapes her by drugging her. Through this action, he believes that Clarissa must accept and marry him. It is suspected that Mrs. Sinclair (the brothel manager) and the other prostitutes assist Lovelace during the rape.\n\nLovelace's action backfires and Clarissa is ever more adamantly opposed to marrying a vile and corrupt individual like Lovelace. Eventually, Clarissa manages to escape from the brothel but Lovelace finds her and by deception manages to get her back to the brothel. She escapes a second time, is jailed for a few days following a charge by the brothel owner for unpaid bills, is released and finds sanctuary with a shopkeeper and his wife. She lives in constant fear of again being accosted by Lovelace who, through one of his close associates and also a libertine – John Belford – as well as through his own family members, continues to offer her marriage, to which she is determined not to accede. She becomes dangerously ill due to the mental duress.\n\nAs her illness progresses, she and John Belford become friends and she appoints him the executor of her will. She is dying and is determined to accept it and proceeds to get all her affairs in order. Belford is amazed at the way Clarissa handles her approaching death and laments what Lovelace has done. In one of the many letters sent to Lovelace he writes \"if the divine Clarissa asks me to slit thy throat, Lovelace, I shall do it in an instance.\" Eventually, surrounded by strangers and her cousin Col. Morden, Clarissa dies in the full consciousness of her virtue and trusting in a better life after death. Belford manages Clarissa's will and ensures that all her articles and money go into the hands of the individuals she desires should receive them.\n\nLovelace departs for Europe and his correspondence with his friend Belford continues. During their correspondence Lovelace learns that Col. Morden has suggested he might seek out Lovelace and demand satisfaction on behalf of his cousin. He responds that he is not able to accept threats against himself and arranges an encounter with Col. Morden. They meet in Munich and arrange a duel.

However, the work functions of the maritime pilot go back to Ancient Greece and Roman times, when incoming ships' captains employed locally experienced harbour captains, mainly local fishermen, to bring their vessels safely into port. Eventually, in light of the need to regulate the act of pilotage and ensure pilots had adequate insurance, the harbours themselves licensed pilots for each harbour.\n Although licensed by the harbour to operate within their jurisdiction, pilots were generally self-employed, meaning that they had to have quick transport to get them from the port to the incoming ships. As pilots were often still dual-employed, they used their own fishing boats to reach the incoming vessels. But fishing boats were heavy working boats, and filled with fishing equipment, and so a new type of boat was required. Early boats were developed from single masted cutters and twin masted yawls, and latterly into the specialist pilot cutter. These were effectively light-weight and over-powered single-masted boats with large, steeply angled keels, making them deep draft under power and shallow draft in lighter sail. If legend is to be believed, the first official Bristol Channel pilot was barge master George James Ray, appointed by the Corporation of Bristol in May 1497 to pilot John Cabot's Matthew from Bristol harbour to the open sea beyond the Bristol channel. In 1837 Pilot George Ray guided Brunel's SS Great Western, and in 1844 William Ray piloted the larger SS Great Britain on her maiden voyage.New York harbor Sandy Hook pilot boats were the Elwood Walter, No. 7, Pet, No. 9, the '\"America, No. 21\", and the William Bell, No. 24. Today[edit] Modern pilot boats can be from 7 metres to over 25 metres in length, built to withstand heavy seas and bumping against 100,000 ton tanker ships. They are high-powered and hence both very quick and durable purpose-built boats. They are normally painted a highly visible colour such as orange, red or yellow. In terms of design, monohull hullforms are most commonly used, though examples of catamarans[2] and SWATHs[3] also exist. Although some pilot boats are still constructed from steel, the need to travel quickly means lighter weight materials such as aluminium, fibreglass and composites are now commonly used. In some instances, such as the Berkeley Class vessels produced in Australia, a combination of materials is used","path":[79489,-4.1256752,50.36409,79309,-4.1256218,50.3640404,79130,-4.125772,50.3639107,78949,-4.12572289,50.3639908,77789,-4.12614679,50.3642006,77637,-4.12593794,50.3640594,77396,-4.13307524,50.3627815,77247,-4.13657904,50.3594818,77098,-4.13768101,50.3543205,76948,-4.13991022,50.3487015,76767,-4.14598703,50.3435593,76590,-4.15490294,50.3404312,76468,-4.16335297,50.3375015,76258,-4.17144489,50.3288803,76107,-4.16440678,50.337059,75928,-4.15782404,50.3403511,75748,-4.15093184,50.3448181,75628,-4.14712286,50.3489494,75420,-4.14200401,50.3538818,75301,-4.13903999,50.3569717,75090,-4.13543797,50.3608284,74912,-4.13137293,50.3630486,74731,-4.12714005,50.3637505,73920,-4.12630701,50.3636093,73804,-4.12557793,50.3634186,73641,-4.12595177,50.3634796,73521,-4.1260252,50.3638802,73400,-4.12551689,50.3644981,73191,-4.1322732,50.3639183,72396,-4.1336751,50.3647194,41373,-4.13373518,50.3646889,41223,-4.13197279,50.3636589,41074,-4.12416506,50.3620987,40924,-4.11886215,50.3614807,40803,-4.11855984,50.3611908,40669,-4.118783,50.3611412,40520,-4.11890507,50.3612099,40279,-4.12415218,50.3617096,40129,-4.13292313,50.36203,39979,-4.14055014,50.3532219,39769,-4.15292978,50.3413811,39589,-4.14793301,50.3437309,39381,-4.14485502,50.3499107,39170,-4.13995218,50.3549805,38930,-4.13566494,50.3607712,38750,-4.13202286,50.3634109,38541,-4.12663317,50.3628082,38421,-4.12371778,50.3616104,38301,-4.12130785,50.3608017,37612,-4.12049723,50.3612785,37401,-4.11925793,50.3610687,37223,-4.128335,50.3633919,37103,-4.13376284,50.3646317]},{"name":"MAREN","text":"MAREN: Germanic feminine given name.

is the Latin and Romance languages word for eagle. Specifically, it may refer to:Aquila (constellation), the astronomical constellation, the Eagle. Aquila (genus), a genus of birds including some eagles. Aquila (name), a given name or surname. Aquila (Roman), a Roman military standard.Aquila is a constellation on the celestial equator. Its name is Latin for 'eagle' and it represents the bird who carried Zeus/Jupiter's thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology. Its brightest star, Altair, is one vertex of the Summer Triangle asterism. The constellation is best seen in the northern summer as it is located along the Milky Way. Because of this location along the line of our Galaxy, many clusters and nebulae are found within its borders, but they are dim and there are few galaxies.Aquila was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. It had been earlier mentioned by Eudoxus in the 4th century BC and Aratus in the 3rd century BC. It is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. The constellation was also known as Vultur volans (the flying vulture) to the Romans, not to be confused with Vultur cadens which was their name for Lyra. It is often held to represent the eagle who held Zeus's/Jupiter's thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology. Aquila is also associated with the eagle who kidnapped Ganymede, a son of one of the kings of Troy (associated with Aquarius), to Mount Olympus to serve as cup-bearer to the gods.Ptolemy catalogued nineteen stars jointly in this constellation and in the now obsolete constellation of Antinous, which was named in the reign of the emperor Hadrian (AD 117–138), but sometimes erroneously attributed to Tycho Brahe, who catalogued twelve stars in Aquila and seven in Antinous. Hevelius determined twenty-three stars in the first[4] and nineteen in the second.The Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle (MUL.A.MUSHEN), which is located in the same area as the Greek

It revolves around the character Betty Suarez who, despite her lack of style, lands a job at a prestigious fashion magazine. The series is based on Fernando Gaitán's Colombian telenovela Yo soy Betty, la fea, which has had many other international adaptations. It was produced by Silent H, Ventanarosa, and Reveille Productions partnered with ABC Studios and executive produced by Salma Hayek, Silvio Horta, Ben Silverman, Jose Tamez, and Joel Fields. The pilot was filmed in New York; seasons one and two were filmed in Los Angeles and seasons three and four in New York City.\n\nDuring its first three seasons, it aired on Thursday nights, where it was mostly successful. However, viewership dropped significantly in the show's third season, particularly in the important 18–49 age group. In October 2009, the series was moved to Fridays, where it had trouble finding an audience. The backlash from its fans prompted ABC to move the show to Wednesdays at 10:00 pm Eastern/9:00 pm Central starting January 6, 2010, where it was thought that it would better complement its Wednesday hits Modern Family and Cougar Town,[1][2] but on January 27, 2010, ABC announced it was canceling the series due to low ratings.[3] Since the show's cancellation, it has gained a cult following. With the end of the series, there was talk of a push by Ana Ortiz and America Ferrera for an Ugly Betty movie.","path":[78839,-4.13094997,50.3676682,77580,-4.13094997,50.3676682,76320,-4.13094711,50.3676491,75061,-4.13096714,50.367691,73800,-4.13099718,50.367691,72360,-4.13247824,50.3674011,71072,-4.13254499,50.3672409,70081,-4.13278818,50.3660698,69872,-4.1329031,50.3651505,69721,-4.13298702,50.3638115,69542,-4.1381669,50.359539,69392,-4.14367199,50.3552589,69242,-4.14921522,50.3510399,69062,-4.15439987,50.3456802,68882,-4.15901279,50.3400307,68703,-4.16372013,50.3344116,68585,-4.16675282,50.3307495,68403,-4.17190313,50.3253899,68223,-4.17701006,50.3203201,68103,-4.18039513,50.3169899]},{"name":"EMILY J","text":"EMILY J:The page \"EMILY J\" does not exist.

also designated Alpha Aurigae (α Aurigae, abbreviated Alpha Aur, α Aur), is the brightest star in the constellation of Auriga, the sixth-brightest in the night sky, and the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere after Arcturus and Vega. A prominent star in the winter sky of the northern hemisphere, it is circumpolar to observers north of 44°N. Its name meaning \"little goat\" in Latin, Capella depicted the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus in classical mythology. The Capella system is relatively close, at only 42.8 light-years (13.1 pc) from the Sun.Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is actually a system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. They have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and swollen, moving off the main sequence. Designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, they are in a very tight circular orbit some 0.76 astronomical units (au)[note 2] apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius. An ageing red clump star, it is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core. Ab is slightly smaller and hotter and of spectral class G1III; it is 72.7 ± 3.6 times as luminous as the Sun and 8.83 ± 0.33 times its radius. It is in a brief evolutionary phase known as the Hertzsprung gap as it expands and cools further to become a red giant. The Capella system is one of the brightest sources of X-rays in the sky, thought to come primarily from the corona of the more massive giant. The second pair, around 10,000 au from the first, consists of two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs. They are designated Capella H and Capella L. Several other stars in the same visual field have been catalogued as companions but are physically unrelated.α Aurigae (Latinised to Alpha Aurigae) is the star's Bayer designation. It also has the Flamsteed designation 13 Aurigae. It is listed in several multiple star catalogues as ADS 3841, CCDM J05168+4559, and WDS J05167+4600. As a relatively nearby star system, Capella is listed in the Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue with designations GJ 194 for the bright pair of giants and GJ 195 for the faint pair of red dwarfs.The traditional name Capella is Latin for (small) female goat; the alternative name Capra was more commonly used in classical times.[11] In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)[12] to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016[13] included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Capella for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.[14] The catalogue of star names lists Capella as applying to the star with the designations α Aurigae, HR 1708, HD 34029, and HIP 24608, which suggests only the primary component of the Capella system should receive that name. The IAU's own documentation makes it explicit that the proper name should strictly only be applied to the visually brightest component. In this case it is somewhat uncertain which of the components is the brightest and the IAU list does not specify.[15]Capella was the brightest star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude. At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period, and it and Capella were situated rather close to each other in the sky and served as boreal pole stars at the time.[16]Capella is thought to be mentioned in an Akkadian inscription dating to the 20th century BC.[17] Its symbolism as a goat dates back to Mesopotamia as a constellation called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. It may have represented the star alone or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the 7th-century BC document MUL.APIN. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of the stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Beta Tauri (Elnath), traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology.[18] It is sometimes called the Shepherd's Star in English literature.[19] Capella was seen as a portent of rain in classical times.[20]Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca state in Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a different orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.[21]Professor William Wallace Campbell of the Lick Observatory announced that Capella was binary in 1899, based on spectroscopic observations—he noted on photographic plates taken from August 1896 to February 1897 that a second spectrum appeared superimposed over the first, and that there was a doppler shift to violet in September and October and to red in November and February—showing that the components were moving toward and away from the Earth (and hence orbiting each other).[22][23] Almost simultaneously, British astronomer Hugh Newall had observed its composite spectrum with a four prism spectroscope attached to a 25 inches (64 cm) telescope at Cambridge in July 1899, concluding that it was a binary star system.[24]Many observers tried to discern the component stars without success.[25] Known as \"The Interferometrist's Friend\", it was first resolved interferometrically in 1919 by John Anderson and Francis Pease at Mount Wilson Observatory, who published an orbit in 1920 based on their observations.[26][27] This was the first interferometric measurement of any object outside the Solar System.[28] A high-precision orbit was published in 1994 based on observations by the Mark III Stellar Interferometer, again at Mount Wilson Observatory.[29] Capella also became the first astronomical object to be imaged by a separate element optical interferometer when it was imaged by the Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope in September 1995.[30]In 1914, Finnish astronomer Ragnar Furuhjelm observed that the spectroscopic binary had a faint companion star, which, as its proper motion was similar to that of the spectroscopic binary, was probably physically bound to it.[31] In February 1936, Carl L. Stearns observed that this companion appeared to be double itself;[32] this was confirmed in September that year by Gerard Kuiper. This pair are designated Capella H and L.[33]Two Aerobee-Hi rocket flights on September 20, 1962, and March 15, 1963, detected and confirmed an X-ray source in Auriga at RA 05h 09m Dec +45°, identified as Capella.[34] Stellar X-ray astronomy started on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from Capella.[35] A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella. During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor.[35] The X-ray luminosity (Lx) of ~1024 W (1031 erg s−1) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun's X-ray luminosity.[35] Capella's X-rays are thought to be primarily from the corona of the more massive star.[36] Capella is ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J051642.2+460001. The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 would require magnetic confinement, unless it is a free-flowing coronal wind.[37]With an apparent magnitude of +0.08, Capella is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest star visible to the naked eye from the latitude 40° N. It appears to be a rich yellowish-white color, although the yellow color is more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky.[38]Capella is closer to the north celestial pole than any other first magnitude star.[39][note 3] Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are on opposite sides of the pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris.[40] Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the winter sky in the northern hemisphere.[41]A few degrees to the southwest of Capella lie three stars Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta Aurigae, the latter two of which are known as \"The Kids\", or Haedi. The four form a familiar pattern, or asterism, in the sky.[42]Based on an annual parallax shift of 76.20 milliarcseconds (with a margin of error of 0.46 milliarcseconds) as measured by the Hipparcos satellite, this system is estimated to be 42.8 light-years (13.12 parsecs) from Earth, with a margin of error of 0.3 light-years (0.09 parsecs).[1] An alternative method to determine the distance is via the orbital parallax, which gives a distance of 42.92 light-years (13.159 parsecs) with a margin of error of only 0.1%.[6] Capella is estimated to have been a little closer to the Solar System in the past, passing within 29 light-years distant around 237,000 years ago.[43] At this range, it would have shone at apparent magnitude −0.82.[44]In a 1960 paper, American astronomer Olin J. Eggen concluded that Capella was a member of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster, after analysing its proper motion and parallax. Members of the group are of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the main sequence after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and are expanding and cooling into red giants.[2][45]There are several stars within a few arc minutes of Capella and some have been listed as companions in various multiple star catalogues. The Washington Double Star Catalog lists components A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and R, with A being the naked-eye star. Most are only line-of-sight companions,[46] but the close pair of red dwarfs H and L are at the same distance as the bright component A and moving through space along with it.[47] Capella A is itself a spectroscopic binary with components Aa and Ab, both giants. The pair of giants is separated from the pair of red dwarfs by 723\".[6] American astronomer Robert Burnham Jr. described a scale model of the system where Capella A was represented by spheres 13 and 7 inches across, separated by ten feet. The red dwarfs were then each 0.7 inches across and they were separated by 420 feet. At this scale, the two pairs are 21 miles apart.[48]Capella A consists of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104 days with a separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes in front of the other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.[6]Modern convention designates the cooler star as component Aa and its spectral type has been usually measured between G2 and K0. The hotter secondary Ab has been given various spectral types of late (cooler) F or early (warmer) G.The MK spectral types of the two stars have been measured a number of times, and they are both consistently assigned a luminosity class of III indicating a giant star.[49] The composite spectrum appears to be dominated by the primary star due to its sharper absorption lines; the lines from the secondary are broadened and blurred by its rapid rotation.[25] The most recent specific published types are K0III and G1III,[5] although older values are still widely quoted such as G5IIIe + G0III from the Bright Star Catalogue[2] or G8III + G0III by Eggen.[45] Where the context is clear, these two components have been referred to as A and B.[50]The individual apparent magnitudes of the two component stars cannot be directly measured, but their relative brightness has been measured at various wavelengths. They have very nearly equal brightness in the visible light spectrum, with the hotter secondary component generally being found to be a few tenths of a magnitude brighter.[6] A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.[51]The physical properties of the two stars can be determined with high accuracy. The masses are derived directly from the orbital solution, with Aa being 2.5687 ± 0.0074 M☉ and Ab being 2.4828 ± 0.0067 M☉. Their angular radii have been directly measured; in combination with the very accurate distance, this gives 11.98 ± 0.57 R☉ and 8.83 ± 0.33 R☉ for Aa and Ab respectively. Their surface temperatures can be calculated by comparison of observed and synthetic spectra, direct measurement of their angular diameters and brightnesses, calibration against their observed colour indices, and disentangling of high resolution spectra. Weighted averages of these four methods give 4,970 ± 50 K for Aa and 5,730 ± 60 for Ab. Their bolometric luminosities are most accurately derived from their apparent magnitudes and bolometric corrections, but are confirmed by calculation from the temperatures and radii of the stars. Aa is 78.7 ± 4.2 times as luminous as the Sun and Ab 72.7 ± 3.6 times as luminous, so the star defined as the primary component is the more luminous when all wavelengths are considered but very slightly less bright at visual wavelengths.[6]Estimated to be 590 to 650 million years old,[6] the stars were probably at the hot end of spectral class A during their main sequence lifetime, similar to Vega. They have now exhausted their core hydrogen and evolved off the main sequence, their outer layers expanding and cooling.[52] Despite the giant luminosity class, the secondary component is very clearly within a brief evolutionary phase known as the Hertzsprung gap and still expanding and cooling towards the red giant branch, making it a subgiant in evolutionary terms. The more massive primary has already passed through this stage, when it reached a maximum radius of 36 to 38 times that of the Sun. It is now a red clump star which is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core, a process that has not yet begun for the less massive star. Detailed analysis shows that it is nearing the end of this stage and starting to expand again which will lead it to the asymptotic giant branch. Isotope abundances[note 4] and spin rates confirm this evolutionary difference between the two stars. Heavy element abundances are broadly comparable to those of the Sun and the overall metallicity is slightly less than the Sun's.[25]The rotational period of each star can be measured by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted.[25] Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.[6]Capella has long been suspected to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than both Rigel and Vega, which are also slightly variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, but it is still only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars.[29] Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.[50]The active atmospheres and closeness of these stars means that they are among the brightest x-ray sources in the sky. However the x-ray emission is due to stable coronal structures and not eruptive flaring activity. Coronal loops larger than the Sun and with temperatures of several million K are likely to be responsible for the majority of the x-rays.[53]The seventh companion published for Capella, and the most distant, is the only one physically associated with the bright primary star. Thus it is also a member of the Hyades Moving Group. It is named as component H and is a red dwarf separated from the pair of G-type giants by a distance of around 10,000 AU.[47] It has its own close companion, an even fainter red dwarf that was 1.8\" away when it was discovered in 1935. Eighty years later the separation had increased to 3.5\", sufficient to allow tentative orbital parameters to be derived. It is component L in double star catalogues.[6][67] The Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue of nearby stars designates the binary system as GJ 195. The two components are then referred to individually as GJ 195 A and B.[10]The two stars are reported to have a 3.5 visual magnitude difference, although the difference is much smaller at infrared wavelengths. This is unexpected and may indicate further unseen companions.[6] The mass of the stars can be determined from the orbital motion, but uncertainties in the orbit have led to widely varying results. In 1975, an eccentric 388 year orbit gave masses of 0.65 M☉ and 0.13 M☉.[67] A smaller near-circular orbit published in 2015 had a 300-year orbit and gave masses of 0.57 M☉ and 0.53 M☉ respectively for GJ 195 A and B.[6]Six visual companions to Capella were discovered before Capella H and are generally known only as Capella B through G. None are thought to be physically associated with Capella although all appear closer in the sky than the HL pair.[48]Component F is also known as TYC 3358-3142-1. It is listed with a spectral type of K[68] although it is included in a catalogue of OB stars as a distant luminous star.[69]Component G is BD+45 1076, with a spectral type of F0,[68] at a distance of 401 light-years (123 parsecs).[70] It is identified as a variable member of the Guide Star Catalogue from Chandra observations although it is not known what type of variability.[71] It is known to be a x-ray source with an active corona.[70]Several other stars have also been catalogued as companions to Capella.[9] Components I, Q, and R are 13th magnitude stars at distances of 92\", 133\", and 134\".[72] V538 Aurigae and its close companion HD 233153 are red dwarfs ten degrees away from Capella; they have very similar space motions but the small difference makes it possible that this is just a coincidence.[73] Two faint stars have been discovered by speckle imaging in the Capella HL field, around 10\" distant from that pair. These have been catalogued as Capella O and P. It is not known whether they are physically associated with the red dwarf binary.[74]Capella traditionally marks the left shoulder of the constellation's eponymous charioteer, or, according to the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy's Almagest, the goat that the charioteer is carrying. In Bayer's 1603 work Uranometria, Capella marks the charioteer's back.[75] The three Haedi had been identified as a separate constellation by Pliny the Elder and Manilius, and were called Capra, Caper, or Hircus, all of which relate to its status as the \"goat star\".[20] Ptolemy merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd century Almagest.[76]In Greek mythology, the star represented the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus. It was this goat whose horn, after accidentally being broken off by Zeus, was transformed into the Cornucopia, or \"horn of plenty\", which would be filled with whatever its owner desired.[17] Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea's owner, a nymph. The myth of the nymph says that the goat's hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the Titans' defeat, after Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his aegis.[77]In medieval accounts, it bore the uncommon name Alhajoth (also spelled Alhaior, Althaiot, Alhaiset, Alhatod, Alhojet, Alanac, Alanat, Alioc), which (especially the last) may be a corruption of its Arabic name, العيوق, al-cayyūq.[78] cAyyūq has no clear significance in Arabic,[79] but may be an Arabized form of the Greek αίξ aiks \"goat\"; cf. the modern Greek Αίγα Aiga, the feminine of goat.[78] To the Bedouin of the Negev and Sinai, Capella al-'Ayyūq ath-Thurayyā \"Capella of the Pleiades\", from its role as pointing out the position of that asterism.[80] Another name in Arabic was Al-Rākib \"the driver\", a translation of the Greek.[78]To the ancient Balts, Capella was known as Perkūno Ožka \"Thunder's Goat\", or Tikutis.[81] Conversely in Slavic Macedonian folklore, Capella was Jastreb \"the hawk\", flying high above and ready to pounce on Mother Hen (the Pleiades) and the Rooster (Nath).[82]Astrologically, Capella portends civic and military honors and wealth.[19] In the Middle Ages, it was considered a Behenian fixed star, with the stone sapphire and the plants horehound, mint, mugwort, and mandrake as attributes. Cornelius Agrippa listed its kabbalistic sign  with the name Hircus (Latin for goat).[83][84]In Hindu mythology, Capella was seen as the heart of Brahma, Brahma Hṛdaya.[19] In traditional Chinese astronomy, Capella was part of the asterism 五車 (Wŭ chē; English: Five Chariots), which consisted of Capella together with Beta, Iota, and Theta Aurigae, as well as Beta Tauri.[85][86] Since it was the second star in this asterism, it has the name 五車二 (Wŭ chē èr; English: Second of the Five Chariots).[87]In Quechua it was known as Colça;[19] the Incas held the star in high regard.[88] The Hawaiians saw Capella as part of an asterism Ke ka o Makali'i (\"The canoe bailer of Makali'i\") that helped them navigate at sea. Called Hoku-lei \"star wreath\", it formed this asterism with Procyon, Sirius, Castor and Pollux.[8] In Tahitian folklore, Capella was Tahi-ari'i, the wife of Fa'a-nui (Auriga) and mother of prince Ta'urua (Venus) who sails his canoe across the sky.[89] In Inuit astronomy, Capella, along with Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), Pollux (Beta Geminorum) and Castor (Alpha Geminorum), formed a constellation Quturjuuk, \"collar-bones\", the two pairs of stars denoting a bone each. Used for navigation and time-keeping at night, the constellation was recognised from Alaska to western Greenland.[90] The Gwich'in saw Capella and Menkalinan has forming shreets'ą įį vidzee, the right ear of the large circumpolar constellation Yahdii, which covered much of the night sky, and whose orientation facilitated navigation and timekeeping.[91]In Australian Aboriginal mythology for the Boorong people of Victoria, Capella was Purra, the kangaroo, pursued and killed by the nearby Gemini twins, Yurree (Castor) and Wanjel (Pollux).[92] The Wardaman people of northern Australia knew the star as Yagalal, a ceremonial fish scale, related to Guwamba the barramundi (Aldebaran).[93]\"Friday's Child\" a 1967 episode of Star Trek: The Original Series written by D.C. Fontana is set on the fictional planet Capella IV.[94] Dr McCoy reports having lived on the planet and being familiar with its culture.[95] The highly regarded 1972 novel The Listeners involves an

MISCHIEF","text":"MORE MISCHIEF:The page \"MORE MISCHIEF\" does not exist. You can ask for it to be created, but consider checking the search results below to see whether the topic is already covered.he mischief rule[1] is one of three rules of statutory interpretation traditionally applied by English courts. The other two are the \"plain meaning rule\" (also known as the \"literal rule\") and the \"golden rule\". The main aim of the rule is to determine the \"mischief and defect\" that the statute in question has set out to remedy, and what ruling would effectively implement this remedy. In applying the mischief rule, the court is essentially asking what part of the law did the law not cover, but was meant to be rectified by Parliament in passing the bill.\nThe rule was first laid out in a 16th-century ruling of the Exchequer Court. Meaning and use[edit] Conway v Rimmer is a rule of construction that judges can apply in statutory interpretation in order to discover Parliament's intention. In applying the rule, the court is essentially asking the question: what was the \"mischief\" that the previous law did not cover, which Parliament was seeking to remedy when it passed the law now being reviewed by the court? The Mischief Rule is of narrower application than the golden rule or the plain meaning rule, in that it can only be used to interpret a statute and, strictly speaking, only when the statute was passed to remedy a defect in the common law. Legislative intent is determined by examining secondary sources, such as committee reports, treatises, law review articles and corresponding statutes.The application of this rule gives the judge more discretion than the literal and the golden rule as it allows him to effectively decide on Parliament's intent. It can be argued that this undermines Parliament's supremacy and is undemocratic as it takes law-making decisions away from the legislature.The way in which the mischief rule can produce more sensible outcomes than those that would result if the literal rule were applied is illustrated by the ruling in Smith v Hughes [1960] 2 All E.R. 859. Under the Street Offences Act 1959, it was a crime for prostitutes to \"loiter or solicit in the street for the purposes of prostitution\". The defendants were calling to men in the street from balconies and tapping on windows. They claimed they were not guilty as they were not in the \"street\". The judge applied the mischief rule to come to the conclusion that they were guilty as the intention of the Act was to cover the mischief of harassment from prostitutes.","path":[79342,-4.16719723,50.364151,78081,-4.16721821,50.364151,76823,-4.16722298,50.3641586,75561,-4.16721487,50.364151,74304,-4.16723824,50.364151,73041,-4.16720295,50.364109,71781,-4.16719484,50.364151,70522,-4.16718292,50.3641701,69261,-4.16718292,50.3641701,68002,-4.16722202,50.3641586,66741,-4.16717815,50.3641701,65423,-4.16721201,50.3641701,65303,-4.16737509,50.3640404,65127,-4.16665316,50.3633919,65007,-4.16658688,50.3626595,64887,-4.16798687,50.3617706,64766,-4.16736698,50.3623085,64649,-4.16864204,50.3621292,64437,-4.17018795,50.3604012,64196,-4.16791677,50.3583183,63957,-4.16462278,50.3570709,63746,-4.1599369,50.3583717,63598,-4.15655899,50.3596001,63416,-4.15289402,50.3597717,63207,-4.14822721,50.3590202,63056,-4.14402008,50.3571091,62906,-4.14103794,50.3544693,62756,-4.13899899,50.3512611,62606,-4.13743496,50.3480301,62397,-4.13418102,50.3437119,62246,-4.13289213,50.3404083,62066,-4.13187599,50.3363304,61886,-4.1306982,50.3323784,61706,-4.12890005,50.3286705,61556,-4.12932205,50.3264008,61377,-4.13403797,50.3246918,61136,-4.14134502,50.322361,60957,-4.14722681,50.3213005,60807,-4.15206718,50.3198318,60629,-4.15811777,50.3192711,60476,-4.16329002,50.3188515,60297,-4.16948795,50.3187599,60147,-4.17463207,50.31884,59997,-4.17970181,50.3197899,59847,-4.1831131,50.3211594,59729,-4.18553686,50.3222008,59608,-4.18659687,50.3232002,59487,-4.18764687,50.3241501,59367,-4.18944502,50.3252106,59248,-4.19084978,50.3260689,59127,-4.19254684,50.3273811,58891,-4.19596291,50.3279114,57811,-4.19618177,50.327919,56424,-4.1961422,50.3278694,55162,-4.19609213,50.3278618,53902,-4.19610214,50.3278389,52642,-4.19608212,50.3278809,51382,-4.19618702,50.3278885,50122,-4.19617319,50.3278885,49943,-4.19614983,50.3278809,48682,-4.19614792,50.3278694,47422,-4.19612598,50.3278885,46163,-4.1961031,50.3278618,44904,-4.19612789,50.3278694,43642,-4.1962328,50.3279419,42384,-4.19603014,50.3278885,41124,-4.19617796,50.327919,39862,-4.19620705,50.3279419,38604,-4.19625902,50.3280296,37162,-4.19625187,50.3280602,35902,-4.19629097,50.3280106,34642,-4.19623518,50.327961,33382,-4.19616699,50.3278885,32122,-4.19613791,50.3279305,30863,-4.19625998,50.3279915,29578,-4.19626284,50.3279991,28317,-4.19619989,50.3280792,27058,-4.19614983,50.3280792,25799,-4.19621181,50.3280792,24537,-4.19624186,50.3280907,23277,-4.19625902,50.3280716,22018,-4.19628811,50.3280487,20757,-4.19620991,50.3280411,19499,-4.19623184,50.3280411,18237,-4.1961298,50.3279305,16978,-4.19600821,50.3279419,15717,-4.19601679,50.3279495,14459,-4.19598484,50.3279686,13198,-4.19602299,50.3279686,11937,-4.19602823,50.3279915,10677,-4.19601679,50.3279915,9417,-4.19601202,50.3279991,8157,-4.19603014,50.3280182,6899,-4.19597292,50.32798,5638,-4.19603205,50.3280106,5457,-4.19600487,50.3280106,5097,-4.19600677,50.3279915,3837,-4.19610214,50.3279419,2577,-4.19604778,50.3279305,1317,-4.19604206,50.3279305,58,-4.19604778,50.3279305]},{"name":"MFV KINDRED SPIRIT","text":"MFV KINDRED SPIRIT:Kindred Spirits on the Roof (Japanese: 屋上の百合霊さん Hepburn: Okujou no Yurirei-san, lit. \"Yuri-spirits on the roof\") is an adult yuri visual novel developed by Liar-soft.

All were manned exclusively by CRNVR. After the outbreak of the Second World War, in the British Crown Colony of Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka), the government of Sir Don Baron Jayatilaka assured the British king and his majesty's government of its continued support.Preparations for war[edit]The British had occupied the coastal areas of the island since 1796, but after 1917 the colony had no regular garrison of British troops. The Ceylon Defence Force and Ceylon Navy Volunteer Reserve were mobilised and expanded. The Royal Navy maintained naval installations in Trincomalee and the Royal Air Force (RAF) had established an aerodrome in China Bay, Trincomalee long before the war.After the fall of Singapore the Royal Navy's East Indies Station was moved to Colombo and then to Trincomalee. Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Ceylon with Air Vice Marshal John D'Albiac Air Officer Commanding and Admiral Sir James Somerville appointed commander of the British Eastern Fleet. The fixed land defences consisted of four coastal batteries at Colombo and five at Trincomalee, these were established just before the war. Air defences were expanded starting in 1941 with the RAF occupying the civil airfield at Ratmalana near Colombo with its station headquarters set up at Kandawala. Another airbase was rapidly built at Koggala near Galle and several temporary airstrips were built across the country, with the largest at Colombo Racecourse Airstrip.

EXPLORER","text":"ECHO EXPLORER:Echo Bay Mines Limited is a Canadian[1] company which was organized in 1964 by Northwest Explorers Limited to develop a silver deposit at Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, which had been staked in 1930 by The Canadian Mining and Smelting Company.[2] The company leased the old Port Radium settlement from Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited and used the old camp and mill to recover silver and copper values from what became known as the Echo Bay Mine. Production in the Echo Bay workings ceased in 1975. The company then reopened the old Eldorado Mine workings and produced more silver and copper until 1981 when low silver prices closed the mine for good.\n\nEcho Bay Mines Limited went on to open a new gold mine by that point, Lupin Mine, in what was then the Northwest Territories and is today in Nunavut.[3] It entered production in 1982.\n\nEcho Bay Mines Limited developed numerous other properties,[4][5] mostly in the United States, including two mines in Nevada, McCoy/Cove and Round Mountain gold mine, and the Kettle River mine in Washington. Corporate headquarters were in Englewood Colorado.\n\nIn 1986 the company purchased Sunnyside Gold Mine in Silverton, Colorado, and operated it for five years before it closed because of low gold prices.[6]\n\nThe company became a subsidiary of Kinross Gold Corporation in 2003 and has been delisted from the stock exchange.","path":[63097,-4.16998291,50.3640099,62884,-4.17281485,50.3646812,62675,-4.17021322,50.3618202,62493,-4.16853523,50.3591194,62253,-4.16610718,50.3564796,62105,-4.1640501,50.3551407,61984,-4.16225719,50.3540802,61775,-4.16009188,50.351429,61624,-4.15885782,50.3498306,61474,-4.15957212,50.3478699,61264,-4.16143179,50.3446999,61114,-4.16293001,50.3422318,60934,-4.1646471,50.3392487,60784,-4.16601515,50.3370399,60604,-4.16751719,50.3345718,60457,-4.1677599,50.3325005,60304,-4.16846704,50.3305283,60095,-4.17008686,50.327919,59944,-4.17127323,50.3258591,59764,-4.17284822,50.3233986,59644,-4.1739831,50.3217087,59526,-4.17497015,50.3200111,59373,-4.17641687,50.3176994,59195,-4.17805815,50.3150711,59043,-4.1795001,50.3126907,58864,-4.18126822,50.3098907,58659,-4.18334484,50.3067017,58505,-4.18486786,50.3042488,58354,-4.18629789,50.3019218,58115,-4.18855286,50.2982101,57904,-4.19042301,50.2949486,57754,-4.1918869,50.2926903,57544,-4.19356298,50.2894516,57395,-4.19481516,50.2871704,57243,-4.19605494,50.2848282,57064,-4.1974721,50.2820511,56944,-4.19841003,50.2802086,56795,-4.19965219,50.2779198,56584,-4.20147181,50.2746696,56464,-4.20229292,50.2728119,56344,-4.20333719,50.2709808,56164,-4.20471096,50.2681694,55983,-4.20623684,50.2653999,55837,-4.20732403,50.2631493,55684,-4.20863819,50.2607918,55506,-4.21102524,50.2581482,55384,-4.21232796,50.2564201,55142,-4.21472216,50.2539215,54811,-4.21672821,50.2530594,54662,-4.21763277,50.2525291,54030,-4.218153,50.2525482,53521,-4.21881723,50.2519493,52710,-4.21691704,50.2520103,52165,-4.21830702,50.2524681,51893,-4.218256,50.2523994,51682,-4.21826315,50.2523918,51444,-4.21844721,50.252491,51082,-4.21823502,50.2524414,50662,-4.21773005,50.2526703,50512,-4.21936178,50.2526817,50122,-4.21996212,50.2526283,49763,-4.21954823,50.2526588,49372,-4.21961689,50.2526703,48385,-4.21978188,50.2521706,45830,-4.20892096,50.2588501,45590,-4.21109486,50.2574081,45438,-4.21259022,50.256649,45198,-4.21491003,50.2555008,44990,-4.21692514,50.2542915,44839,-4.2186718,50.2529297,44595,-4.22014284,50.2512016,44381,-4.22146702,50.2510681,43871,-4.2193799,50.2507401,43123,-4.21676779,50.2533302,42944,-4.21409702,50.2544708,42787,-4.21473312,50.2541389,42609,-4.21630716,50.2536507,42490,-4.21689177,50.2532082,42371,-4.21783781,50.2524414,41950,-4.21858501,50.2515984,41282,-4.21710491,50.2525101,40344,-4.21970701,50.2520294,40045,-4.21957207,50.2523918,39409,-4.21836185,50.2536888,38097,-4.21946096,50.2523804,37282,-4.21978521,50.2537689,37013,-4.22132206,50.2518005,35993,-4.2203002,50.2527313,35845,-4.22001982,50.2518082,35129,-4.21972704,50.2514992,34886,-4.21835899,50.252739,34288,-4.2196722,50.2521286,33901,-4.21858597,50.2523193,33412,-4.22016001,50.2532692,33241,-4.21995783,50.2526283,33123,-4.22000217,50.2523613,31692,-4.21967602,50.2517815,31442,-4.21935177,50.2553482,31322,-4.21959209,50.2556,31177,-4.21990013,50.2553596,30996,-4.21964598,50.2523384,29873,-4.21961021,50.2519798,29641,-4.22050524,50.2541199,29417,-4.22062492,50.2540817,28879,-4.22027779,50.2530899,28185,-4.21956778,50.2528114,28005,-4.21943188,50.2525482,27825,-4.2193222,50.2524681,27647,-4.21930313,50.2524414,27462,-4.21924782,50.2524414,26406,-4.21886683,50.2523689,26075,-4.21851301,50.2524605,25775,-4.21877718,50.2523918,25141,-4.21930504,50.2522583,25022,-4.21971178,50.2523193,24902,-4.21943712,50.2525291,24782,-4.21946812,50.2523384,24577,-4.2193222,50.2523499,24216,-4.21936321,50.2523689,23820,-4.21934319,50.2523804,23670,-4.2196269,50.2523117,23460,-4.2193222,50.2522202,23344,-4.21912003,50.2523804,22804,-4.21912479,50.2521896,22563,-4.21896219,50.2518082,22413,-4.21848679,50.2517319,22054,-4.20560312,50.2684097,21901,-4.19636011,50.2833099,21722,-4.18854284,50.2961388,21601,-4.18313599,50.3045998,21457,-4.17913723,50.3110085,21274,-4.17119789,50.3237915,21096,-4.16407204,50.3360481,20914,-4.15810823,50.3455811,20764,-4.15791178,50.3491783,20645,-4.15899277,50.3501205,20525,-4.16059685,50.35186,20373,-4.16222811,50.3541298,20225,-4.16590214,50.3570709,19984,-4.16928005,50.3604088,19773,-4.17218208,50.3637695,19560,-4.172328,50.3649483,18299,-4.16993713,50.3639908]},{"name":"WINDFALL OF WESSEX","text":"WINDFALL OF WESSEX:The page \"WINDFALL OF WESSEX\" does not exist.

The three classification levels for Wachau wine include Steinfeder for wines up to 11.5% alcohol level, Federspiel for wines between 11.5–12.5% and Smaragd that must have a minimum of 12.5% alcohol level.[1] Despite its renown, the Wachau is a small wine region that usually accounts for only around 3% of Austria's wine production.[2]Archeological evidence suggests that viticulture may have been introduced to the lands around the Danube by the Celtic tribes, most notably the La Tène and Noricum federation, prior to the Roman influence that came into the area following conquest around the 1st century BCE. Viticulture continued to flourish under Roman rule, with the introduction of Roman technology and knowledge, even though grape growing was technically banned in Roman territories north of the Alps. In the 3rd century, Emperor Marcus Aurelius Probus officially overturned the ban and is reported to have ordered the introduction of several grape varieties to be brought into the territories.[1] It has been speculated that both Grüner Veltliner and Welschriesling may have been introduced to the region during the Roman period.[3]The first written account to specifically mention wine production in the Wachau region was the writings of Eugippus in his biography of St. Severin, where the 5th-century Roman wine production at the Roman fort near the town of Mautern in the Wachau.[4][5][6] After the fall of the Roman Empire the Wachau region, along with most of Lower Austria down across the Pannonian Plain, was ravaged by repeated waves of barbarian invasions that took a toll on all forms of agriculture and trade. Wachau's wine industry entered a dark age from which it did not emerge until the time of Charlemagne in the late 8th and early 9th century. Under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire, the monastic influences of the Christian church continued to promote and sustain viticulture in the area. Much as the monasteries mapped out and planted plots along choice lands in the Burgundy and Mosel wine regions, the monks in the Wachau identified vineyard sites along the northern banks of the Danube that would be ideal for viticulture. Many vineyards that exist today in the Wachau can trace their origins to monastic plantings in the Middle Ages and Renaissance period.[4]From the 14th–16th century, viticulture in the Wachau hits its peak along with the rest of Lower Austria with plantings an estimated 10 times greater across the land than what exist today. Unfortunately, this period saw the development of a surplus wine lake due, in part, to overproduction and competition from neighboring Germany and Hungary. As prices and influence in the important Vienna market was being affected, Wachau producers banded with neighboring Austrian producers to demand protectionist tariffs and eventually an outright ban on any \"foreign\" wine being imported into Lower Austria. These measures helped stabilize the Wachau wine industry to some degree until the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century, followed by the phylloxera epidemic that would reach Austria later that century, would devastate the vineyards of Wachau. Slowly the wine industry would recover and during the 20th century, the Wachau would gain a global reputation for the quality of its dry Riesling and Grüner Veltliner. Then the 1985 diethylene glycol wine scandal, caused by producers outside the Wachau, gained international attention and caused a dramatic drop in sales for Austrian wines across the board.[4]The Wachau, along with the rest of the Austrian wine industry, responded to the scandal with the development of strict wine laws and quality assurances. Producers in the Wachau already had a head start on this movement with the development a couple years earlier of the Vinea Wachau in 1983, a collaborative association that aimed to distinguish Wachau wine from other Austrian wines. In addition to holding its members to a guaranteed minimum quality level above the requirements of Austrian wine laws, the Vinea Wachau also established its own classification and wine labeling system that is still being used for Wachau wines today.[1][7]The boundaries of the Wachau has traditionally been the valley of the Danube between the village of Melk and Krems.[5] Along with the Kremstal and Kamptal, the Wachau is one of the coolest wine regions in Austria.[4] The climate of Wachau is influenced by the confluence of several weather systems including cool, moist air from the Waldviertel forests of the northwest with warmer air coming from the east off the Pannonian Plain. This creates a continental climate with marked diurnal temperature variations that include a dramatic drop in nighttime temperatures. Along with the moderating influence of the Danube river, the Wachau has a macroclimate which includes constant air and heat circulation, allowing for sugars and phenolic compounds to build up during the day but acids and aromas to be preserved by the cooler nights. This creates white wines that tend to be high in extract and acidity.[1] Irrigation is often necessary during the peak months of the growing season when yearly rain totals fall below 500 mm (20 in).[2]The vineyard soils of the Wachau are varied but consist primarily of rock outcrops with occasional layers of loess. The geography of the region is characterized by steep, rocky river banks (as steep as those found in the Mosel and Côte-Rôtie[2]) that have had vineyards terraced into the hillsides.[1] Higher up on the hills, the soils are rich in iron deposits and contain mixtures of gneiss, granite and slate. Closer to the river and in the flatter plains areas that dot the region, the soil is more alluvial with loess, sand and gravel.[4] The heart of the Wachau district is the Vinea Wachau Nobilis Districtus which includes a strip of vineyard land that stretches 20 km (12 mi) from the western extremity of Schwallenbach along the Danube through Spitz, Weissenkirchen, Dürnstein, Loiben and finally to Mautern.[1] There are over 900 named vineyard sites in Wachau (known as Rieden).[2] Among the sites that may appear on Wachau wine labels those of the Loibenberg, Kellerberg, Achleiten, Klaus and 'Singerriedel are the most noted.[4]There are over 1,350 hectares (3,300 acres) of vineyards in the Wachau with Grüner Veltliner being the most widely planted. The area is also well known for its Riesling that carry distinctive trademarks of their terroir in aroma and flavor profile. Other varieties grown in the Wachau include Chardonnay (sometimes called Feinburgunder), Neuburger, Gelber Muskateller, Pinot blanc, Traminer and Sauvignon blanc.[4] Riesling is often planted on the most ideal vineyard location along the steep gneiss hillsides near the river while Grüner Veltliners seems to thrive on the loess and sand of the lower banks. The wines are rarely, if ever, exposed to new oak or malolactic fermentation and are typically produced in a fuller bodied, higher extract style that is more similar to the wines of Alsace than of their German counterparts.[2]Unlike most Austrian wines which follow a classification system similar to Germany (which includes wines labeled based on must weight at harvest such as Spätlese, Auslese, etc.), the Wachau has its own classification system for quality wine. In favorable vintages, producers may experience botrytis and can produce botrytized wines that carry the same classification as their counterparts in other Austrian wine regions—namely Beerenauslese and Trockenbeerenauslese.[4]The Wachau designations include:Like other Austrian wines, wines from the Wachau are usually labeled by varietal with the grape variety listed needing to constitute at least 85% of the grape variety. Similarly, at least 85% of the grapes from a given harvest must come from the a vintage year on the label.[1]The Vinea Wachau is an organization of Wachau producers who united in 1983 to create a trade association that will not only promote Wachau wines worldwide but also protect the image and integrity of the Wachau wine region. Using the historical seal of Leuthold I von Kuenring (1243–1313), a local Ministerialengeschlecht or knight of the powerful Kuenringer family, the organization outlined the Vinea Wachau Nobilis Districtus or \"heart of Wachau\" which included the wine villages where traditionally the best Wachau wine was produced. Today the organization includes more than 200 members, who collectively own more than 85% of the vineyard land in the Wachau.[5]Members of the Vinea Wachau not only must follow Austria's strict wine laws but also abide by the association's own standards. The wines designated as Steinfeder, Federspiel and Smaragd cannot be chaptalized or back-sweetened with süssreserve. All wine submitted by members are tasted by a panel for quality assurances with samples of every wine, from every vintage stored at a facility at Spitz so it is available for comparison should any quality control issues emerge.[5]","path":[79255,-4.14477682,50.3487701,77995,-4.14471722,50.34869,76734,-4.14465904,50.3487816,75473,-4.144485,50.3485909,74213,-4.14432812,50.348629,72952,-4.14447784,50.3487015,71692,-4.14426994,50.3486099,70431,-4.14423513,50.3485489,69171,-4.14429188,50.3485298,67910,-4.1442852,50.348629,66650,-4.14425278,50.3485603,65389,-4.14425182,50.3485603,64129,-4.144104,50.3484497,62868,-4.14403009,50.3483696,61607,-4.14403009,50.3484383,60347,-4.14378023,50.3479309,60064,-4.14409208,50.3476105,59845,-4.14556503,50.3473282,59664,-4.14831781,50.3453598,59525,-4.14962482,50.3435097,59375,-4.15166903,50.3414803,59234,-4.15501785,50.3398895,59084,-4.15965319,50.3375893,58944,-4.16474485,50.3343697,58803,-4.170609,50.330349,58664,-4.17449713,50.3250084,58525,-4.17441797,50.31847,58405,-4.17330503,50.3125305,58264,-4.16699505,50.3065681,58065,-4.1542182,50.3002586,57915,-4.14449596,50.2955894,57714,-4.131145,50.2898407,57554,-4.1202631,50.2854691,57394,-4.10926723,50.2810707,57244,-4.09868479,50.2771912,57094,-4.08826399,50.2733116,56955,-4.07850313,50.2697182,56825,-4.06957293,50.2663116,56674,-4.05926323,50.2624397,56514,-4.04836798,50.2582092,56315,-4.03489494,50.2530289,56164,-4.02456999,50.2490311,56014,-4.01444817,50.2451096,55885,-4.00570202,50.2417297,55754,-3.99693203,50.2383308,55594,-3.98612309,50.2341614,55454,-3.9766829,50.2305489,55313,-3.96717501,50.2268486,55164,-3.95697498,50.2229881,55025,-3.94758201,50.2193909,54884,-3.93804693,50.2157211,54744,-3.92880797,50.2120705,54604,-3.91927195,50.2084198,54463,-3.90966201,50.2045784,54325,-3.89993811,50.2008514,54175,-3.88926697,50.1967583,53975,-3.87520289,50.1914406,53824,-3.86555195,50.1873894,53685,-3.85620499,50.1845818,53515,-3.84363794,50.1845894,53365,-3.83252311,50.1846008,53204,-3.82063699,50.1845589,53033,-3.80789995,50.1845894,52833,-3.79314494,50.1846008,52704,-3.78362203,50.1845398,52544,-3.77190804,50.1844902,52354,-3.75806189,50.1843491,52225,-3.74868488,50.1841583,52073,-3.73771,50.1845016,51914,-3.7263751,50.1852417,51703,-3.71139002,50.1861305,51545,-3.70016503,50.1867104,51385,-3.68878007,50.1872292,51244,-3.67864799,50.1875916,51095,-3.66798806,50.1883316,50944,-3.65786695,50.1904793,50804,-3.64837289,50.1925316,50664,-3.63901997,50.1944618,50524,-3.62956309,50.1964684,50385,-3.62013292,50.198391,50244,-3.61056304,50.2003403,50103,-3.60093808,50.2021904,49963,-3.5918169,50.2049294,49814,-3.58413291,50.2097015,49674,-3.57687211,50.2142906,49524,-3.56907201,50.2191696,49384,-3.56181693,50.2237587,49255,-3.55510306,50.227951,49105,-3.5471921,50.2327309,48965,-3.5401969,50.2375984,48825,-3.53387189,50.2427711,48684,-3.52744794,50.2479897,48544,-3.52206993,50.2536087,48413,-3.51728296,50.2590408,48254,-3.51139212,50.2656288,48114,-3.50617504,50.2714005,47954,-3.5000999,50.2781296,47736,-3.49173689,50.287159,47605,-3.48682189,50.2924614,47473,-3.48164511,50.2978783,47324,-3.47654009,50.3043098,47155,-3.47227812,50.3119888,47005,-3.46855688,50.3188095,46875,-3.46520805,50.3247299,46744,-3.46190691,50.3306999,46614,-3.45862794,50.3366089,46424,-3.45369291,50.3454018,46283,-3.45010209,50.3517609,46161,-3.44692302,50.3572693,46034,-3.44344497,50.3631516,45904,-3.4420929,50.3694,45764,-3.44245195,50.3763618,45572,-3.44285297,50.3858185,45431,-3.44310498,50.3926506,45305,-3.44334197,50.3990097,45145,-3.44343305,50.4068489,45005,-3.44361997,50.4137993,44804,-3.44460797,50.4236488,44655,-3.44239497,50.4306602,44526,-3.4403379,50.436779,44396,-3.44072795,50.4431992,44215,-3.44100189,50.4522018,44024,-3.44387507,50.4615211,43834,-3.44857502,50.4706001,43706,-3.45181704,50.4767799,43585,-3.45476007,50.4825706,43456,-3.45846295,50.4888115,43335,-3.4633069,50.4958305,43206,-3.46529293,50.500679,43075,-3.467273,50.5072289,42917,-3.46965504,50.5151901,42794,-3.47141504,50.5209198,42674,-3.47380209,50.5261917,42475,-3.4776001,50.5347214,42275,-3.48495293,50.5395889,42134,-3.49122,50.5395393,41911,-3.5012269,50.5399895,41774,-3.50079989,50.5425415,41638,-3.50064707,50.5446281,41463,-3.50328994,50.5458794,41359,-3.50364709,50.5459518,40098,-3.50364804,50.5459404,38838,-3.50373793,50.5459518,37577,-3.50362301,50.5459709,36317,-3.50363302,50.5460091,35056,-3.5036099,50.5459785,33796,-3.50355005,50.545929,32535,-3.50356698,50.54599,31274,-3.50370002,50.54599,30014,-3.50358009,50.5458908,28753,-3.50366497,50.5459099,27492,-3.50363493,50.5459518,26232,-3.50357199,50.5459518,24971,-3.50359702,50.5459785,23711,-3.50370502,50.5459518,22450,-3.50359988,50.5459518,21190,-3.50360799,50.5459709,19929,-3.50366712,50.5459709,18669,-3.50363994,50.545929,17408,-3.50364208,50.5459785,16148,-3.50370193,50.5459785,14887,-3.50367188,50.5459595,13626,-3.5036819,50.5459595,12366,-3.50361705,50.5459595,11105,-3.50359201,50.5459709,9844,-3.50364304,50.5459518,8584,-3.50359797,50.5459595,7323,-3.50345993,50.5459518,6063,-3.50331712,50.5458717,4802,-3.50363207,50.5457916,3542,-3.50353289,50.5459518,2281,-3.50359297,50.5460091,1021,-3.50356793,50.5458984]},{"name":"GUIDING LIGHT III","text":"GUIDING LIGHT III:Guiding Light (known as The Guiding Light before 1975) is an American television soap opera listed in Guinness World Records as the longest-running drama in television in American history, broadcast on CBS for 57 years from June 30, 1952, until September 18, 2009, preceded by a 19-year broadcast on radio.[1] Guiding Light is the longest running soap opera[4][a] and the fifth-longest running program in all of broadcast history; only the American country music radio program Grand Ole Opry (first broadcast in 1925), the BBC religious program The Daily Service (1928), the CBS religious program Music and the Spoken Word (1929), and the Norwegian children's radio program Lørdagsbarnetimen (first aired in 1924, cancelled in 2010) have been on the air longer.\n\nGuiding Light was created by Irna Phillips, and began as an NBC Radio serial on January 25, 1937. On June 2, 1947, the series was transferred to CBS Radio,[6] before starting on June 30, 1952, on CBS Television.[1] It continued to be broadcast concomitantly on radio until June 29, 1956. The series was expanded from 15 minutes to a half-hour during 1968 (and also switched from broadcasting live to pre-taping around this same time), and then to a full hour on November 7, 1977. The series broadcast its 15,000th CBS episode on September 6, 2006.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, it was announced that CBS had canceled Guiding Light, after a 72-year run, due to low ratings. The show taped its final Procter & Gamble scenes for CBS on August 11, 2009,[7] and its final episode on the network aired on September 18, 2009.[8] On October 5, 2009, CBS replaced Guiding Light with

RICHARD","text":"GRACE RICHARD:Colonel Richard Grace (c.1612–1691) was an Irish Royalist soldier who fought for Charles I, Charles II and James II.Biography[edit]Grace, the younger son of Robert Grace, feudal baron of Courtstown, was born the early part of the 17th century,[1] of a Kilkenny family that may have been descended from Odo, Count of Champagne.He resided at Moyelly Castle, Queen's County, and served Charles I in England, until the surrender of Oxford in 1646. He then returned to Ireland, and was for some years engaged in the Irish Confederate Wars. He is referred to in State Papers as being at the head of 3,000 men, harassing the Parliamentary troops — now in Wicklow, and again at Crogan, beyond the River Shannon.In 1652 a reward of £300 was by the English Commonwealth government set upon his head, yet at the conclusion of the war he was permitted to enter the Spanish service with 1,200 of his men. At the Battle of the Dunes (1658) he commanded the Lord Ormond's regiment of Irish in the services of King Charles II.[4] After some time he went over to the French side, without betraying any trust imposed upon him, having given due notice to his Spanish friends. After the Restoration he was appointed Chamberlain to the Duke of York (the future James II), and in consideration of his faithful and indefatigable services, received \"pensions of £400, and a portion at least of his estates were restored to him.\" When James II. came to Ireland, Grace was appointed Governor of Athlone, with a garrison of three regiments of foot, and eleven troops of cavalry.After the Battle of the Boyne, Athlone was invested by General Douglas with ten regiments of foot, and five of horse. Grace having burnt the English town, and broken down the bridge, defended the Connaught works with indomitable spirit. When called upon to surrender, he fired a pistol over the messenger's head, and declared: \"These are my terms; these only will I give or receive; and when my provisions are consumed, I will defend till I eat my old boots.\" At the end of a week, Douglas was obliged to draw off, with the loss of 400 men. The town was again invested by Godert de Ginkell in 1691.Marquis de St Ruth had meanwhile obliged Grace to exchange three of his veteran regiments for inferior French troops. Nevertheless, he made a heroic defence under St Ruth, and on 30 June 1691, after de Ginkell's passage of the Shannon and the capture of the citadel on the Connaught side, Colonel Grace's body was found under the ruins. His conduct towards the Protestants within his district is described as having been peculiarly humane and just; and although the severity of his discipline contrasted with the irregularities tolerated in other portions of the Irish army, he was greatly beloved by his men.","path":[78593,-4.12400007,50.3586082,77334,-4.12400007,50.3586197,76072,-4.12399817,50.3586197,74814,-4.12399006,50.3586197,73552,-4.12399101,50.3586082,72292,-4.12399483,50.3586082,71033,-4.12399006,50.3586197,69772,-4.12399817,50.3586311,68515,-4.12398815,50.3586311,67252,-4.12399006,50.3586197,65993,-4.12399483,50.3586197,64735,-4.12400484,50.3586197,63473,-4.12398291,50.3586197,62213,-4.12398291,50.3586082,60953,-4.12400818,50.3586311,60711,-4.12396288,50.3586693,60562,-4.12393522,50.3595505,60316,-4.12375402,50.3588982,59980,-4.12342596,50.359539,59832,-4.12440205,50.3602486,59710,-4.12363005,50.3598099,59590,-4.12435293,50.3611107,59440,-4.12728024,50.3627892,59290,-4.13099718,50.3628693,59167,-4.13290501,50.3619385,59016,-4.13554096,50.3600693,58839,-4.13759899,50.3573685,58688,-4.13960218,50.3554688,58478,-4.14218998,50.3532104,58328,-4.14373684,50.3515015,58208,-4.14566183,50.35009,58087,-4.14786482,50.3486595,57967,-4.15040016,50.3476181,57786,-4.15469599,50.3464317,57578,-4.15969515,50.3450394,57399,-4.16346312,50.3435898,57216,-4.16742706,50.3419189,57038,-4.17115498,50.3400688,56857,-4.17463779,50.3380699,56707,-4.17762995,50.3364182,56526,-4.18165016,50.3345909,56348,-4.18592978,50.3328094,56166,-4.19012785,50.3307495,56048,-4.19315004,50.3292618,55074,-4.1949048,50.3272896,53814,-4.19494009,50.3272781,52554,-4.19494295,50.3273315,51294,-4.19506216,50.3273811,51114,-4.19511223,50.3274002,49855,-4.19491482,50.3273201,49674,-4.1950531,50.3273582,49314,-4.19510984,50.3273582,48054,-4.19501781,50.3273506,46794,-4.19488811,50.3273582,46614,-4.19496679,50.3273392,45715,-4.19496012,50.3273697,45535,-4.19488716,50.3273392,44634,-4.19500208,50.3273888,43374,-4.19503021,50.3273811,42114,-4.19508505,50.3275299,41935,-4.1949482,50.3274803,41034,-4.19509506,50.3274002,39774,-4.19513321,50.3275108,38514,-4.19514322,50.327549,37254,-4.19508219,50.3275299,36026,-4.19489813,50.3276215]},{"name":"PROVIDER II BF422","text":"The page \"PROVIDER II BF422\" does not exist.

Inventor Frederick Smith's wife dies during the birth of their fourth baby, Ronnie, leaving the family in the care of their faithful housekeeper Emma. Twenty years later, after Smith's inventions have made the family rich, the affable Ronnie, who is Emma's favorite, arrives home from college, announcing that he wants to quit school and become a pilot. The other Smith children, Bill, Gypsy and Isabelle, have all grown into spoiled adults, but Emma lovingly indulges them all, making excuses for their bad behavior to their father and everyone else.As Emma leaves for her first vacation in thirty-two years with the family, the absent-minded Frederick sadly takes her to the station. She gets cold feet and decides to stay home, but Frederick won't let her and decides to go along with her to Niagara Falls. Waiting for their train, Frederick proposes and Emma accepts, even though she is afraid that people will talk. When the children learn about the marriage, Ronnie is happy for them, but the other children are embarrassed by the blot on their social record. On their honeymoon, as the happy Frederick and Emma row on the lake, they are teased by some young vacationers, prompting Frederick to take the oars from Emma. The exertion causes a mild heart attack and they return home. As the contented Frederick listens to Emma sing to him, he dies, and a short time later, the family learns that he has left his entire estate to Emma.Though Emma wants to give the money back to the children, all of them except Ronnie turn on her and threaten to prove that their father was crazy when he wrote the will. Emma throws them out and awaits the lawsuit they threaten while the loyal Ronnie goes to Canada for a flying assignment. Because the will cannot be broken, the children go to the district attorney to have him bring murder charges against Emma, using distorted testimony by Mathilda, the maid. When Ronnie hears about the trial, he desperately flies East to help Emma but is killed while flying through a dangerous storm. Even though her life is in peril, she won't allow her kind attorney, Haskins, to defame the character or motives of the children. Her emotional plea for them in court results in her acquittal, but Emma's relief is ruined when she learns of Ronnie's death. A short time later, Emma gives all of the money to the children, telling Haskins that she hopes that now they will think better of her. After she sadly views Ronnie's body, Isabell, Bill and Gypsy beg her forgiveness and want her to stay with them, but she refuses, saying that her work with them is finished, but no matter what happens or where they all are, they will still belong to each other.At a new position, Emma happily attends a doctor's large family and is pleased when the wife agrees to name her new baby Ronnie at Emma's request.The film was a big hit and made a profit of $898,000.[2] Marie Dressler was also nominated as Best Actress at the 5th Academy Awards where Helen Hayes in The Sin of Madelon Claudet emerged victorious. Dressler had won the award the year before with Min and Bill.","path":[56678,-4.13324404,50.3679199,56138,-4.13269186,50.3665009,55988,-4.13266706,50.3658905,55868,-4.13280821,50.3649216,55748,-4.13325596,50.3631401,55630,-4.13553286,50.3615417,55418,-4.1401701,50.3587799,55269,-4.14152098,50.3555107,55089,-4.14361477,50.3519516,54940,-4.14578295,50.3489609,54762,-4.1488471,50.3456612,54611,-4.15210199,50.3432503,54459,-4.15584517,50.3415184,54309,-4.15810013,50.3395119,54191,-4.16075516,50.3365898,54009,-4.16365099,50.33181,53802,-4.167202,50.3264084,53651,-4.1695528,50.3221016,53470,-4.17207289,50.3164482,53352,-4.17388296,50.3127518,53172,-4.17680311,50.3073006,52961,-4.18027496,50.3008118,52781,-4.18358994,50.2952118,52631,-4.18617487,50.2905502,52513,-4.18829679,50.2871094,52361,-4.19103003,50.2825584,52181,-4.19419479,50.2773209,52001,-4.19747019,50.2719002,51822,-4.20080996,50.2661896,51641,-4.20252514,50.2601013,51494,-4.20326519,50.2603302,51312,-4.21307993,50.2607307,51192,-4.21965218,50.2602501,50984,-4.23013496,50.2588387,50832,-4.23801184,50.2580605,50654,-4.24678516,50.2572784,50474,-4.25608492,50.2577209,50323,-4.26305008,50.2567902,50173,-4.27018023,50.256031,50025,-4.27747011,50.2551689,49874,-4.28478289,50.2542915,49693,-4.2936368,50.25317,47027,-4.42715502,50.23489,45048,-4.52532101,50.2217598,44391,-4.55784798,50.2184105,44149,-4.56948709,50.2172585,43909,-4.58080482,50.2160683,43730,-4.58947182,50.2156105,43551,-4.59789991,50.2151299,43399,-4.60509682,50.2145615,43160,-4.61648703,50.2136688,43039,-4.62187004,50.2128716,42829,-4.63148403,50.2112198,42652,-4.63928986,50.2098312,42501,-4.64620018,50.2086105,42350,-4.65305901,50.2074318,42200,-4.65947485,50.2062302,42082,-4.66495323,50.2052689,41962,-4.67057514,50.2041893,41781,-4.67938519,50.2026291,41602,-4.68801212,50.2009697,41482,-4.69390678,50.1999397,41331,-4.70120716,50.1985817,41182,-4.70857477,50.1971893,40971,-4.71905899,50.1952286,40791,-4.72816181,50.1936989,40642,-4.73543215,50.1922188,40492,-4.7427578,50.1909409,40312,-4.75187492,50.1893883,40162,-4.75956011,50.1880913,39953,-4.77015209,50.1863213,39803,-4.77759218,50.1850204,39655,-4.78485298,50.1838303,39504,-4.7922802,50.1826515,39384,-4.79820681,50.1816711,39174,-4.80847597,50.1799202,39024,-4.81581211,50.1786919,38844,-4.82445478,50.1771011,38725,-4.83030319,50.1759415,38574,-4.83763981,50.1745987,38424,-4.84467602,50.173069,38216,-4.85444689,50.1708717,38034,-4.86282778,50.1686211,37855,-4.87140799,50.1664505,37704,-4.87813282,50.164711,37585,-4.88349485,50.163269,37374,-4.89308786,50.1606789,37225,-4.89991713,50.1587601,37019,-4.90920687,50.1560593,36865,-4.91570902,50.1540718,36746,-4.91997004,50.1524506,36624,-4.92492008,50.150589,36415,-4.93305683,50.1475105,36267,-4.93919706,50.1453285,36145,-4.94345999,50.1433983,35966,-4.94961023,50.1411705,35816,-4.95522213,50.1398697,35813,-4.95522213,50.1398697,35667,-4.96166992,50.1384315,35547,-4.9670372,50.1372604,35426,-4.9726181,50.1360703,35277,-4.9792819,50.1351089,35098,-4.9864831,50.1343002,34890,-4.99403715,50.133461,34768,-4.99936485,50.1335411,34587,-5.00682783,50.1332588,34438,-5.01361513,50.1331291,34230,-5.02241707,50.135479,34049,-5.02494812,50.1404991,33902,-5.02755022,50.1442909,30381,-5.0656848,50.1545601]},{"name":"TIR NA NOG","text":"TIR NA NOG:In Irish mythology and folklore, Tír na nÓg ([tʲiːɾˠ n̪ˠə ˈn̪ˠoːɡ]; \"Land of the Young\") or Tír na hÓige (\"Land of Youth\") is one of the names for the Otherworld, or perhaps for a part of it. It is depicted as a supernatural realm of everlasting youth, beauty, health, abundance and joy.[1] Its inhabitants are the Tuatha Dé Danann, the gods of pre-Christian Ireland.[1] In the echtrae (adventure) and immram (voyage) tales, various Irish mythical heroes visit Tír na nÓg after a voyage or an invitation from one of its residents. They reach it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, or by going under water or across the sea.[1]Other Old Irish names for the Otherworld include Tír Tairngire (\"Land of Promise/Promised Land\"),[1][2] Tír fo Thuinn (\"Land under the Wave\"),[1] Mag Mell (\"Plain of Delight/Delightful Plain\"),[1] Ildathach (\"Multicoloured place\"),[3] and Emain Ablach (the Isle of Apple Trees).Tír na nÓg is best known from the tale of Oisín and Niamh.[4] In the tale, Oisín (a human hero) and Niamh (a woman of the Otherworld) fall in love. She brings him to Tír na nÓg on a magical horse that can travel over water. After spending what seems to be three years there, Oisín becomes homesick and wants to return to Ireland. Niamh reluctantly lets him return on the magical horse, but warns him never to touch the ground. When he returns, he finds that 300 years have passed in Ireland. Oisín falls from the horse. He instantly becomes elderly, as the years catch up with him, and he quickly dies of old age.[3]\"A leannan sidhe,\" a beautiful fairy sweetheart, \"can lure you against your will into Tir-na-nOg,\" wrote Patrick Harpur.[5]the composer (Sir) Arnold Bax wrote many classical pieces about Tir na NOg, specifically \"Nympholept\" (becoming transfixed by a woody nymph in Tir na NOg) , his Third Symphony, about going to Tir na NOg and the Sixth Symphony in which Tir na NOg breaks off from our world and floats off into the ether never to come again.Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison's sixteenth studio album \"No Guru, No Method, No Teacher\" released in 1986 includes a song titled \"Tir Na Nog.\"In the 1997 movie Titanic, towards the end, as the water fills the ship, an Irish mother (played by Jeanette Goldstein) can be seen telling the tale to her two children as they fall asleep in their bed.The 1998-1999 show Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog by Saban Entertainment[6] prominently features a fantasy version of Tír na nÓg. In this show the land is inhabited by fairy people and is accessible by touching a single stone on specific rock formations.Brazilian celtic metal band Tuatha de Danann released a song called \"Tir Nan Og (Land of Youth)\" included in the album Trova di Danú in 2004.This story of Oisín and Niamh bears a striking similarity to many other tales, including the Japanese tale of Urashima Tarō.[7] Francis Hindes Groome recorded another such tale in his Gypsy Folk Tales.[8] Another version concerns King Herla, a legendary king of the ancient Britons, who visited the Otherworld, only to return some two hundred years later after the lands had been settled by the Anglo-Saxons. The \"Seven Sleepers of Ephesus\", a group of Christian youths who hid inside a cave outside the city of Ephesus around 250 AD, purportedly awoke approximately 180 years later during the reign of Theodosius II.","path":[60178,-4.1326251,50.3691406,57836,-4.13283205,50.3672714,57182,-4.13270712,50.3664703,55151,-4.13387203,50.3613205,54940,-4.13779688,50.3578682,54790,-4.14077282,50.3550491,54641,-4.14363098,50.3522911,54490,-4.14482784,50.3514709,54341,-4.14337301,50.3530083,54191,-4.14642477,50.3497887,54040,-4.15004206,50.3467484,53890,-4.1540451,50.343811,53740,-4.15748596,50.3410416,53560,-4.16107178,50.3372917,53411,-4.16375399,50.3340912,53260,-4.16657686,50.3309517,53051,-4.16967821,50.3258705,52901,-4.17204905,50.3217506,52661,-4.17601681,50.3150215,52480,-4.17915821,50.3098907,36340,-4.87965679,50.1649094,35860,-4.90155506,50.15728,35620,-4.91264677,50.1534882,35472,-4.9189682,50.1511307,35291,-4.92637777,50.1478882,35140,-4.93263292,50.1454697,34990,-4.93864298,50.1429596,34810,-4.94483995,50.1405487,34631,-4.95116186,50.1378212,34450,-4.95852518,50.1352386,34271,-4.96592903,50.1325302,34121,-4.97227812,50.1303787,33941,-4.97982788,50.1276093,33761,-4.98752022,50.1246109,33613,-4.99360323,50.1220398,33491,-4.99885321,50.1198807,33340,-5.00432491,50.1175308,33162,-5.01079512,50.1150093,33011,-5.0157752,50.1128082,32862,-5.02126789,50.1104698,32711,-5.02685022,50.1086807,32532,-5.03363323,50.1073303,32412,-5.03812599,50.1062698,32231,-5.0463419,50.1043587,32113,-5.05131102,50.1030807,31961,-5.05753517,50.1015015,31811,-5.06380987,50.0998306,31632,-5.07026815,50.0983086,31483,-5.07636213,50.0978584,31300,-5.0838871,50.0975189,31121,-5.09110403,50.0971107,30971,-5.09691,50.096859,30791,-5.10316181,50.0964699,30401,-5.10819817,50.0968094]},{"name":"ELSIE LEIGH","text":"ELSIE LEIGH:Darlings of the Gods is a 1989 Australian mini series about the 1948 trip to Australia by Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh and the Old Vic Company, where Olivier and Leigh met Peter Finch.[1] Cast[edit]\nAnthony Higgins - Laurence Olivier\nMel Martin - Vivien Leigh\nJerome Ehlers - Peter Finch\nRhys McConnochie - Ralph Richardson\nAnthony Hawkins - Cecil Tennant\nBarry Quin - Dan Cunningham\nJackie Kellehr - Elsie Beyer\nLindy Davies - Antonia Vaughan\nNicki Paull - June Kelly\nShane Briant - Cecil Beaton\nVivien Leigh (born Vivian Mary Hartley, and also known as Lady Olivier after 1947; 5 November 1913 – 8 July 1967) was an English stage and film actress.[1] She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress for her iconic performances as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939) and Blanche DuBois in the film version of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949. She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of Tovarich (1963).\n\nAfter her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in Fire Over England (1937). Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that her physical attributes sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress. Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of Noël Coward and George Bernard Shaw comedies to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet, and Lady Macbeth. Later in life, she performed as a character actress in a few films.\n\nAt the time, the public strongly identified Leigh with her second husband Laurence Olivier, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films. She earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, and for much of her adult life she suffered from bipolar disorder as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, which was first

Substation Events (GSE) is a control model defined as per IEC 61850 which provides a fast and reliable mechanism of transferring event data over entire substation networks. When implemented, this model ensures the same event message is received by multiple physical devices using multicast or broadcast services. The GSE control model is further subdivided into GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Events) and GSSE (Generic Substation State Events).Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) is a controlled model mechanism in which any format of data (status, value) is grouped into a data set and transmitted within a time period of 4 millisecond. The following mechanisms are used to ensure specified transmission speed and reliability.[1]Generic Substation State Events (GSSE) is an extension of event transfer mechanism in UCA2.0. Only Status data can be exchanged through GSSE and it uses a status list (string of bits) rather than a dataset as is used in GOOSE. GSSE messages are transmitted directly over IEC/ISO 8802-2 and 8802-3 using a similar mechanism to GOOSE messages (refer IEC 61850-7-1 Clause 12.2, IEC 61850-8-1 Clause 6.4). As the GSSE format is simpler than GOOSE it is handled faster in some devices. GSSE is being progressively superseded by the use of GOOSE and support for it may eventually disappear.[2]Equipment manufacturers have started to offer non-standard protocols to report events over substation networks, citing advantages to these approaches.

It was created by Sol Saks under executive director Harry Ackerman, and starred Elizabeth Montgomery, Dick York (1964–1969), Agnes Moorehead, David White and Erin Murphy. Dick Sargent replaced an ill York for the final three seasons (1969–1972). The show is about a witch who marries an ordinary mortal man, and vows to lead the life of a typical suburban housewife. Bewitched enjoyed great popularity, finishing as the number two show in America during its debut season, and becoming the longest-running supernatural-themed sitcom of the 1960s–1970s. The show continues to be seen throughout the world in syndication and on recorded media.In 2002, Bewitched was ranked #50 on \"TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\".[1] In 1997, the same magazine ranked the season 2 episode \"Divided He Falls\" #48 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\".[2]A beautiful witch named Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) meets and marries a mortal named Darrin Stephens (originally Dick York, later Dick Sargent). While Samantha complies with Darrin's wishes to become a normal suburban housewife, her magical family disapproves of the mixed marriage and frequently interferes in the couple's lives. Episodes often begin with Darrin becoming the victim of a spell, the effects of which wreak havoc with mortals such as his boss, clients, parents, and neighbors. By the epilogue, however, Darrin and Samantha most often embrace, having overcome the devious elements that failed to separate them. The witches and their male counterparts, warlocks, are very long-lived; while Samantha appears to be a young woman, many episodes suggest she is actually hundreds of years old. To keep their society secret, witches avoid showing their powers in front of mortals other than Darrin. Nevertheless, the effects of their spells – and Samantha's attempts to hide their supernatural origin from mortals – drive the plot of most episodes. Witches and warlocks usually use physical gestures along with their incantations. To perform magic, Samantha often twitches her nose to create a spell. Special visual effects are accompanied by music to highlight such an action.The main setting for most episodes is the Stephens' house at 1164 Morning Glory Circle, in an upper-middle-class suburban neighborhood, either in Westport, Connecticut or Patterson, New York as indicated by conflicting information presented throughout the series. The season 3 episode \"Soap Box Derby\" shows the Mills Garage in Patterson as a neighbor's son's car sponsor, and the Stephens' station wagon is seen with New York plates. Elizabeth Montgomery owned a second home in Patterson. Many scenes also take place at the fictional Madison Avenue advertising agency \"McMann and Tate\", where Darrin works.During its run, the series had a number of major cast changes, often because of illness or death of the actors. In particular, the performer playing Darrin was replaced mid-season.According to Harpie's Bizarre,[3] (a website based on the frequently-depicted \"witch magazine\" from the series) creator Sol Saks' inspirations for this series in which many similarities can be seen were the film I Married a Witch (1942) developed from Thorne Smith's unfinished novel The Passionate Witch, and the John Van Druten Broadway play Bell, Book and Candle, which was adapted into the 1958 movie.[4]In I Married a Witch, Wallace Wooley (Fredric March) is a descendant of people who executed witches at the Salem witch trials. As revenge, a witch (Veronica Lake) prepares a love potion for him. She ends up consuming her own potion and falling for her enemy. Her father is against this union.[4] In the film of Bell, Book and Candle, modern witch Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) uses a love spell on Shep Henderson (James Stewart) to have a simple fling with him but genuinely falls for the man.[4]Both films were properties of Columbia Pictures, which also owned Screen Gems, the company that produced Bewitched.[5]Sol Saks, who received credit as the creator of the show, wrote the pilot of Bewitched though he was not involved with the show after the pilot. Creator Saks, executive producer Harry Ackerman, and director William Asher started filming the pilot on November 22, 1963; it coincided with the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Asher felt personally affected by the event as he knew Kennedy; he had produced the 1962 televised birthday party where Marilyn Monroe sang \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\". But the show had to go on.[6] The pilot concerned \"the occult destabilization of the conformist life of an upwardly mobile advertising man\".[6]First season producer and head writer Danny Arnold set the initial style and tone of the series, and also helped develop supporting characters such as Larry Tate and the Kravitzes. Arnold, who wrote on McHale's Navy and other shows, thought of Bewitched essentially as a romantic comedy about a mixed marriage; his episodes kept the magic element to a minimum. One or two magical acts drove the plot, but Samantha often solved problems without magic. Many of the first season's episodes were allegorical, using supernatural situations as metaphors for the problems any young couple would face. Arnold stated that the two main themes of the series were the conflict between a powerful woman and a husband who cannot deal with that power, and the anger of a bride's mother at seeing her daughter marry beneath her. Though the show was a hit right from the beginning, finishing its first year as the number 2 show in the United States, ABC wanted more magic and more farcical plots, causing battles between Arnold and the network.[citation needed]Its first season, Bewitched was the number one show of the American Broadcasting Company and the best rated sitcom among all three networks. It was second in ratings only to Bonanza.[6] Bewitched aired at 9 pm Thursday evenings. It was preceded on the air by another sitcom, My Three Sons, and followed by the soap opera Peyton Place. My Three Sons finished 13th in the ratings and Peyton Place ninth. The block formed by the three shows was the strongest ratings grabber in ABC's schedule.[6]Arnold left the show after the first season, leaving producing duties to his friend Jerry Davis, who had already produced some of the first season's episodes (though Arnold was still supervising the writing). The second season was produced by Davis and with Bernard Slade as head writer, with misunderstandings and farce becoming a more prevalent element but still included a number of more low-key episodes in which the magic element was not front and center. With the third season and the switch to color, Davis left the show, and was replaced as producer by William Froug. Slade also left after the second season. According to William Froug's autobiography, William Asher (who had directed many episodes) wanted to take over as producer when Jerry Davis left, but the production company was not yet ready to approve the idea. Froug, a former producer of Gilligan's Island and the last season of The Twilight Zone, was brought in as a compromise. By his own admission, Froug was not very familiar with Bewitched and found himself in the uncomfortable position of being the official producer even though Asher was making most of the creative decisions. After a year, Froug left the show, and Asher took over as full-time producer of the series for the rest of its run. The first two seasons had aired Thursdays at 9:00, and the time was moved to 8:30 shortly after the third year (1966–1967) had begun. Nevertheless, the ratings for Bewitched remained high and it placed among the top fifteen shows through the 1968-69 season. It was the seventh highest-rated show in both the U.S. '65-'66 and '66-'67 schedules. Similarly, it was number 11 the following two years.[6]At the time, the show had won three Emmy Awards. William Asher won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series in 1966.Alice Pearce posthumously won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal of Gladys Kravitz and Marion Lorne won the same award posthumously in 1968 for her portrayal of Aunt Clara. Producers were faced with how to deal with the deaths of both these actresses. When Pearce died in the spring of 1966, only a few episodes of season two remained to be filmed. Mary Grace Canfield was hired to play Gladys's sister-in-law, Harriet Kravitz in four episodes. Comedian Alice Ghostley was approached to take over the role of Gladys the next season, but turned it down. Instead, Sandra Gould was hired. Marion Lorne was not replaced, and the character of Aunt Clara was not seen after the fourth season. Rather, beginning in the show's sixth year, Ghostley was finally used to play the character of Esmeralda, a kind but shy and inept witch. In another notable casting change, Louise Tate, played by Irene Vernon during the first two seasons, was played by Kasey Rogers thereafter. During the fifth season (1968–1969), Serena (Samantha's identical cousin, also played by Montgomery) was used more frequently. Filming of scenes involving both Samantha and Serena was accomplished by using Melody McCord, Montgomery's stand-in.In this same season, in the most notable of the show's many cast changes, Dick York became unable to continue his role as Darrin because of a severe back condition, the result of an accident during the filming of They Came To Cordura (1959). Starting with the third season, York's disability had caused ongoing shooting delays and script rewrites resulting in increasingly frequent episodes without Darrin. After collapsing while filming the episode \"Daddy Does His Thing\" and being rushed to the hospital in January 1969, York left the show permanently. That same month, Dick Sargent was cast to play Darrin beginning in the sixth season.[7] The remainder of the fifth season was filmed without York and features many episodes where Darrin is away on business. At about the same time, Montgomery and Asher announced that they were expecting another baby and it was decided that Samantha and Darrin would also have another child in the fall of that year. On screen, Samantha tells Darrin over the phone the news of her second pregnancy.Beginning with the sixth season's (1969–1970) opening credits, in addition to York being replaced with Sargent, Elizabeth Montgomery was billed above the title, and David White now received billing as well, after Agnes Moorehead's. During this year, the show saw a significant decline in ratings, falling from eleventh to 24th place. In mid-1970, the set of the Stephens' home was being rebuilt due to a fire. In June, the cast and crew traveled to Salem, Magnolia, and Gloucester, Massachusetts to film an eight-part story arc in which Samantha, Darrin, and Endora travel to Salem for the centennial Witches Convocation. These location shoots marked the only times the show would film away from its Hollywood studio sets and backlot. Season seven premiered with eight so-called 'Salem Saga' episodes. On June 15, 2005, TV Land unveiled a Samantha statue in Salem to mark the show's 40th anniversary.[8] On hand were three surviving actors from the show, Bernard Fox, Erin Murphy, and Kasey Rogers, as well as producer/director William Asher.[9]These on-location episodes helped the show's sagging ratings,[10] but after the Salem episodes, viewership again dwindled. Scripts from old episodes were recycled frequently. The year's ratings for Bewitched had fallen and the show did not even rank in the list of the top thirty programs. ABC moved Bewitched 's airtime from Thursdays at 8:30 pm to Wednesdays at 8:00 pm at the beginning of the eighth season. The schedule change did not help ratings as the show was now pitted against CBS's popular The Carol Burnett Show. Fewer recurring characters were used this season, with the Kravitzes, Darrin's parents, and Uncle Arthur not appearing at all. Filming ended in December 1971, and in January 1972 the show was finally moved to Saturday night at 8:00 pm, opposite television's number one show, All in the Family, where it fared even worse, with Bewitched finishing in 72nd place for the year.In the episode \"Samantha's Power Failure\", Serena's and Uncle Arthur's powers are removed by the Witches' Council. The impotent duo get jobs in a confectionery factory, with both tossing and hiding an onslaught of bananas from a conveyor belt which are to be dipped in chocolate and nuts, then packaged. This episode mimics the famous chocolate assembly-line episode of I Love Lucy (\"Job Switching\"), which was directed by Bewitched producer/director William Asher. Serena's and Arthur's jokes and physical antics are taken from Lucy's (Lucille Ball) and Ethel's (Vivian Vance) playbook. In the episode \"Samantha's Supermaid\" Samantha interviews a maid, and the scene is almost identical to one in Lucy. Season 8 featured a European vacation, but was filmed in Hollywood using stock footage, like the \"European\" episodes of Lucy. Similar to Endora's refusal to pronounce Darrin's name correctly, Lucy's mother always referred to son-in-law Ricky with incorrect names, including \"Mickey\", and in a letter once, \"what's-his-name\".The 1959 Columbia Pictures film Gidget was filmed on location at a real house in Santa Monica (at 267 18th Street). The blueprint design of this house was later reversed and replicated as a house facade attached to an existing garage on the backlot of Columbia's Ranch. This was the house seen on Bewitched. The patio and living room sets seen in Columbia's Gidget Goes to Rome (1963) were soon adapted for the permanent Bewitched set for 1964. The interior of the Stephens' house can be seen, substantially unaltered, in the Jerry Lewis film Hook, Line & Sinker (1969). The set was also used several times in the television series Gidget and I Dream of Jeannie, as well as the made-for-television movie Brian's Song (1971). It was also used, as a setting for an opening tag sequence, for the final episode of the first season of another Screen Gems property, The Monkees and in an episode of The Fantastic Journey. The house served as Doctor Bellows' house on I Dream of Jeannie, and was seen in an episode of Home Improvement when Tim Taylor took Tool Time on location to the house of Vinnie's mother to repair a gas leak in the furnace in the basement, but unknown to Tim there was also a leak at the stove in the kitchen. A clap on-Clap off lamp turned on when Tim clapped and it blew up. The Stephens house was also featured in a Fruit of the Loom Christmas commercial. On the Columbia studio backlot, the Kravitzes' house was actually down the street from the Stephenses' house exterior. Both houses' exterior doors opened to an unfinished eighteen-by-fifteen-foot entry, as the interiors were shot on studio sound stages elsewhere. A \"front porch\" set, replicating the porch of the backlot house was created as well. From 1964 through 1966 the Kravitzes' house was the same as used for The Donna Reed Show and was later used for the house sets from The Partridge Family. Production and filming for Bewitched was based in Los Angeles and, although the setting is assumed to be New York, several episodes feature wide-angle exterior views of the Stephenses' neighborhood showing a California landscape with mountains in the distance. Another example of questionable continuity regarding the location can be seen in Season 6, Episode 6: Darrin's parents drive home after visiting the new baby, passing several large palm trees lining the street.Feminist Betty Friedan wrote the essay \"Television and the Feminine Mystique\" (February, 1964) where she criticized the way women were portrayed in television. She summarized their depiction as stupid, unattractive, and insecure household drudges. Their time was divided between dreaming of love and plotting revenge on their husbands. Samantha was not depicted this way and Endora used Friedan-like words to criticize the boring drudgery of household life.[4] Others have looked at the way that the series 'play[ed] into and subvert[ed] a rich load of cultural stereotypes and allusions' regarding witches, gender roles, advertising and consumerism.[14]In the episode \"Eat at Mario's\" (May 27, 1965), Samantha and Endora co-operate in using their witchcraft to defend and promote a quality Italian restaurant. They take delight in an active, aggressive role in the public space, breaking new ground in the depiction of women in television.[4]Walter Metz attributes the success of the series to its snappy writing, the charm of Elizabeth Montgomery, and the talents of its large supporting cast. The show also made use of respected film techniques for its special effects. The soundtrack was unique, notably where it concerned the synthesized sound of nose twitching.[6]The first episodes feature a voice-over narrator \"performing comic sociological analyses\" of the role of a witch in middle class suburbia. The style was reminiscent of Hollywood films such as Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957).[4] In a 1991 audio interview with film historian Ronald Haver, Elizabeth Montgomery revealed that her father, Robert Montgomery was originally approached to narrate these episodes but he refused. Instead, the narration was done by Academy Award-winning actor Jose Ferrer, who did not receive credit.The series inspired rival show I Dream of Jeannie (1965–1970), a program that, while in first run, was never a major ratings hit.[6]The 1965 episode of The Flintstones titled \"Samantha\" (1965), features Dick York and Elizabeth Montgomery as Darrin and Samantha Stephens, who have just moved into the neighborhood. This crossover was facilitated because both series were broadcast on ABC.[15]An animated cartoon made in 1972 by Hanna-Barbera Productions for The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie, this featured teenage versions of Tabitha and Adam visiting their aunt and her family who travel with a circus.In 1977, a short-lived spin-off entitled Tabitha aired on ABC. Lisa Hartman plays Tabitha, now an adult working with her brother Adam at television station KXLA. There were several continuity differences with the original series. Adam and Tabitha had both aged far more than the intervening five years between the two series would have allowed. Adam also had become Tabitha's older mortal brother, rather than her younger warlock brother, as he was in Bewitched. Supporting character Aunt Minerva (Karen Morrow) says she has been close to Tabitha since childhood, though she had never been mentioned once in the original series. Tabitha's parents are mentioned but never appear. However Bernard Fox, Sandra Gould, George Tobias and Dick Wilson reprised their roles as Dr. Bombay, Gladys Kravitz, Abner Kravitz, and \"various drunks.\"Bewitched inspired a 2005 film starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. The film, departing from the show's family-oriented tone, is not a remake but a re-imagining of the sitcom, with the action focused on arrogant, failing Hollywood actor Jack Wyatt (Ferrell) who is offered a career comeback playing Darrin in a remake of Bewitched. The role is contingent upon him finding the perfect woman to play Samantha. He chooses an unknown named Isabel Bigelow (Kidman), who is an actual witch. The film was written, directed, and produced by Nora Ephron, and was poorly received by most critics and was a financial disappointment. It earned $22 million less than the production cost domestically. However it earned an additional $68 million internationally. The New York Times called the film \"an unmitigated disaster.\"[16]Dell Comics adapted the series into a comic book series in 1964. The art work was provided by Henry Scarpelli.[17]In 1966, the series was adapted as a strip in Lady Penelope, beginning from issue 12 and lasting until the comic's demise in 1969.[18]On October 22, 2014, Sony Pictures Television announced that it has sold a pilot of Bewitched to NBC as a possible entry for the 2015—2016 US television season. However, this version will focus on Tabitha's daughter Daphne, a single woman who despite having magical powers as her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, is determined not to use it to find a soul mate. The new version of the proposed series, which is being written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, had been on the radar of several major networks, including ABC, after Sony began shopping the project to interested parties.[21]After completing its original run, ABC Daytime and ABC Saturday Morning continued to show the series until 1973. Bewitched has since been syndicated on many local US broadcast stations, including Columbia TriStar Television as part of the Screen Gems Network syndication package from 1973–82 and then since 1993, which featured by 1999 bonus wraparound content during episode airings.From 1973 to 1982, the entire series was syndicated by Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures. By the late '70s, many local stations skipped the black and white episodes or only ran those in the summer due to a perception that black-and-white shows usually had less appeal than shows filmed in color. From 1981 to about 1991, only the color episodes were syndicated in barter syndication by DFS Program Exchange. The first two seasons, which were in black and white were not included and Columbia retained the rights to those. Beginning in 1989, Nick at Nite began airing only the black-and-white episodes, which were originally unedited back then. The edited ones continued in barter syndication until 1992. Columbia syndicated the entire series beginning in 1991. The remaining six color seasons were added to Nick at Nite's lineup in March 1998 in a week-long Dueling Darrins Marathon. Seasons 1–2 were later colorized and made available for syndication and eventually DVD sales. Cable television channel WTBS carried seasons 3–8 throughout the 1980s and 1990s from DFS on a barter basis like most local stations that carried the show did.The Hallmark Channel aired the show from 2001 to 2003; TV Land then aired the show from 2003 to 2006, and it returned in March 2010,[22] but left the schedule in 2012. In October 2008, the show began to air on WGN America, and in October 2012 on Logo, limited to the middle seasons only. Channel 9 Australia airs the series on its digital channel GO! Russia-based channel Domashny aired the show from 2008 to 2010. MeTV aired the show in conjunction with I Dream of Jeannie from December 31, 2012 to September 1, 2013.[23] The show now airs on Antenna TV.The show has been distributed by Columbia Pictures Television (1974–1982, 1988 (black and white ones only until 1990)-1996), DFS/The Program Exchange (1980–1991, 2010–present), Columbia TriStar Television (1996–2002), and Sony Pictures Television (2002–present).Selected episodes may be viewed on iTunes, YouTube, Internet Movie Database, Hulu, The Minisode Network, Crackle, and Amazon.com.Beginning in 2005, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released all eight seasons of Bewitched. In regions 1 and 4, seasons 1 and 2 were each released in two versions—one as originally broadcast in black-and-white, and one colorized. The complete series set only contains the colorized versions of Seasons 1–2. Only the colorized editions were released in regions 2 and 4.On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including Bewitched.[24] They have subsequently re-released the first six seasons, with seasons 1 & 2 available only in their black and white versions.[25][26][27]On October 6, 2015, Mill Creek Entertainment re-released Bewitched- The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1.[28] Special features were stripped from the release.","path":[79353,-4.15602684,50.3668594,78094,-4.15600204,50.3668709,76835,-4.15600491,50.3668709,75574,-4.15599012,50.3668709,74314,-4.15599203,50.3668709,73053,-4.15599823,50.3668709,71795,-4.15599823,50.3668709,70533,-4.15599489,50.3668709,69276,-4.15599012,50.3668709,68014,-4.15599489,50.3668785,66754,-4.15598202,50.3668785,65495,-4.15599823,50.3668785,64234,-4.15600491,50.3668709,62975,-4.15599298,50.3668785,61715,-4.15600204,50.3668709,60454,-4.15600014,50.3668709,59194,-4.15601015,50.3668709,57934,-4.15599823,50.3668709,56675,-4.15599489,50.3668785,55414,-4.15600014,50.3668709,54095,-4.15535402,50.366581,53855,-4.15482521,50.3643303,53674,-4.15303278,50.3619118,53524,-4.15212822,50.3602791,53283,-4.14976215,50.3582993,53133,-4.14735317,50.3550911,52984,-4.14575005,50.3505898,52864,-4.14296484,50.3470306,52714,-4.14032984,50.3426094,52535,-4.13747597,50.3373985,52383,-4.13551283,50.3331795,52204,-4.13354206,50.3283806,52055,-4.13163996,50.3241882,51904,-4.13010979,50.3202705,51724,-4.12817001,50.3151894,51514,-4.12353706,50.3096809,51336,-4.11820507,50.3058815,51155,-4.11177206,50.3024101,50975,-4.10634995,50.2987709,50794,-4.09957504,50.2957993,50644,-4.0941968,50.2930603,50495,-4.08862019,50.2902603,50163,-4.07594299,50.2841301,50045,-4.0717268,50.2819405,49863,-4.07193518,50.2837296,49713,-4.07487488,50.2870407,40597,-4.10177183,50.3030815,40418,-4.10992718,50.3037109,40266,-4.11641312,50.3054504,40087,-4.12434816,50.3088112,39937,-4.13085222,50.3112907,39787,-4.13742781,50.3144112,39669,-4.14282179,50.3168488,39518,-4.14924288,50.3197708,39366,-4.15524006,50.3229485,39187,-4.15993977,50.3259697,39008,-4.15270281,50.3258514,38888,-4.14746284,50.3259583,38739,-4.14149523,50.3264198,38587,-4.13474989,50.3264008,38379,-4.1308651,50.3278313,38229,-4.1327219,50.3312798,38108,-4.13474703,50.3340797,37956,-4.13710213,50.3379211,37720,-4.14010715,50.343441,37568,-4.14233398,50.347271,37388,-4.1451602,50.3516998,37239,-4.14711714,50.3550301,37087,-4.1485219,50.357399,36966,-4.14905977,50.3583717,36818,-4.14986277,50.3597488,36669,-4.15337276,50.3621101,36487,-4.15528202,50.3650589,36367,-4.15560484,50.3660507,36249,-4.15553713,50.366909,36071,-4.15599012,50.3668709,34811,-4.1559968,50.3668785,33552,-4.15598822,50.3668709,32293,-4.15600014,50.36689,31033,-4.1559968,50.3668709,29772,-4.15598822,50.36689,28512,-4.15599012,50.3668785,27254,-4.15598202,50.3668709,25992,-4.15599823,50.3668594,24732,-4.1559968,50.3668709,23473,-4.15601015,50.3668594,22211,-4.15599012,50.3668709,20952,-4.15599012,50.3668709,19693,-4.15599489,50.3668594,18433,-4.15599489,50.36689,17171,-4.15599298,50.3668709,15912,-4.15598488,50.3668709,14651,-4.15598822,50.3668709,13392,-4.15599298,50.3668709,12132,-4.15599823,50.3668594,10872,-4.15600491,50.3668709,9613,-4.15600014,50.3668594,8351,-4.15599298,50.3668709,7092,-4.15599012,50.3668594,5833,-4.15599203,50.3668709,4572,-4.15598679,50.3668785,3312,-4.15598297,50.36689,2052,-4.156003,50.3668785,792,-4.15599489,50.3668785]},{"name":"WHIMBREL","text":"WHIMBREL:The whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) is a wader in the large family Scolopacidae. It is one of the most widespread of the curlews, breeding across much of subarctic North America, Europe and Asia as far south as Scotland.This is a migratory species wintering on coasts in Africa, South America, south Asia into Australasia and southern North America. It is also a coastal bird during migration.[2] It is fairly gregarious outside the breeding season.This is a fairly large wader though mid-sized as a member of the curlew genus. The English name is imitative of the bird's call.[3] The genus name Numenius is from Ancient Greek noumenios, a bird mentioned by Hesychius. It is associated with the curlews because it appears to be derived from neos, \"new\" and mene \"moon\", referring to the crescent-shaped bill. The species name phaeopus is the Medieval Latin name for the bird, from Ancient Greek phaios, \"dusky\" and pous, \"foot\".[4]It is 37–47 cm (15–19 in) in length, 75–90 cm (30–35 in) in wingspan, and 270–493 g (9.5–17.4 oz) in weight.[5] It is mainly greyish brown, with a white back and rump (subspecies N. p. phaeopus and N. p. alboaxillaris only), and a long curved bill (longest in the adult female) with a kink rather than a smooth curve. It is generally wary.The usual call is a rippling whistle, prolonged into a trill for the song.The only similar common species over most of this bird's range are larger curlews. The whimbrel is smaller, has a shorter, decurved bill and has a central crown stripe and strong supercilia.There are seven subspecies:[6]This species feeds by probing soft mud for small invertebrates and by picking small crabs and similar prey off the surface. Before migration, berries become an important part of their diet. It has also been observed taking insects, specifically blue tiger butterflies.[7]The nest is a bare scrape on tundra or Arctic moorland. Three to five eggs are laid. Adults are very defensive of nesting area and will even attack humans who come too close.Near the end of the 19th century, hunting on their migration routes took a heavy toll on this bird's numbers; the population has since recovered.In the British Isles, it breeds in Scotland, particularly around Shetland, Orkney, the Outer Hebrides as well as the mainland at Sutherland and Caithness.The whimbrel is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.Egg of whimbrel - MHNTInflight whimbrel in Lónsöræfi, IcelandID compositeWhimbrel stamp of the Faroe Islands","path":[53328,-4.13154984,50.3645897,53117,-4.13284779,50.3626709,52966,-4.13632011,50.3588905,52816,-4.13779402,50.3547096,52668,-4.14023018,50.3507385,52517,-4.14291286,50.3467102,52399,-4.14384222,50.3442192,52277,-4.14287186,50.3450699,52067,-4.14345598,50.3475418,51918,-4.14804506,50.3483009,51768,-4.15333796,50.3473206,51618,-4.15585899,50.3448181,51468,-4.15757704,50.3419189,51288,-4.15996599,50.3385696,51108,-4.16179514,50.3349609,50929,-4.16136503,50.3310089,50778,-4.15809679,50.3277092,50658,-4.15490484,50.3252182,50509,-4.15080214,50.3221283,50328,-4.14593506,50.3182106,50148,-4.14174986,50.3141708,49913,-4.13676596,50.30867,49730,-4.13399315,50.3043098,49550,-4.13172817,50.3000908,49399,-4.12914181,50.2967491,49220,-4.1256299,50.2927818,49069,-4.12261677,50.2894516,48889,-4.11914301,50.2854691,48711,-4.11579704,50.2816315,48560,-4.11316299,50.2784119,48440,-4.1110878,50.2757797,48260,-4.10834217,50.2716293,48140,-4.10717201,50.2686501,47960,-4.105937,50.2641716,47780,-4.10463476,50.2596703,47602,-4.10326481,50.2551384,47451,-4.10091782,50.2514,47272,-4.09682178,50.2475815,47122,-4.09346199,50.2443619,46941,-4.08961678,50.2404709,46731,-4.08536005,50.2359314,46554,-4.0821619,50.2320595,46404,-4.08287477,50.2330093,46252,-4.08648777,50.2364502,46072,-4.0908699,50.2407608,45833,-4.09000015,50.2401085,45654,-4.08664179,50.2363701,45444,-4.08257484,50.2318916,45263,-4.07889509,50.2278709,45118,-4.07584286,50.2247505,44967,-4.07289314,50.2215118,44814,-4.069767,50.2182312,44666,-4.06656218,50.2151718,44515,-4.06398487,50.2123985,44363,-4.06611681,50.2152405,44214,-4.06887484,50.2184715,44034,-4.07220602,50.2224693,43795,-4.07699203,50.22789,43614,-4.08068991,50.2319107,43375,-4.0855031,50.2369308,43136,-4.08997297,50.2420807,42957,-4.09367323,50.2461319,42806,-4.09720993,50.2495499,42685,-4.10001516,50.2523117,42538,-4.10339212,50.255661,42386,-4.10693502,50.2592087,42267,-4.10955477,50.2619591,42116,-4.11293316,50.2652016,41937,-4.11688995,50.2692108,41727,-4.12157679,50.2738686,41577,-4.12505722,50.2771912,41398,-4.12876701,50.2810898,41217,-4.13159704,50.2851181,41067,-4.13398218,50.2886391,40918,-4.13642502,50.29216,40737,-4.13928699,50.2966118,40589,-4.14164495,50.3002396,40437,-4.14440012,50.3039894,40288,-4.14709902,50.3076286,40110,-4.15027905,50.3121605,39958,-4.15285301,50.3160706,39748,-4.15682793,50.3206406,39568,-4.16298485,50.3232498,39418,-4.16779184,50.3256798,39211,-4.17214298,50.3292809,39031,-4.16710186,50.3292694,38879,-4.16164017,50.3287811,38699,-4.1548419,50.3278389,38521,-4.14858818,50.3264885,38370,-4.14380598,50.3267097,38249,-4.13971996,50.32658,38100,-4.134583,50.3261185,37923,-4.12949514,50.3259888,37800,-4.13030481,50.3274002,37619,-4.13210011,50.3300285,37443,-4.13436699,50.3326302,37320,-4.13618517,50.3345604,37142,-4.13877487,50.3377686,37020,-4.13952398,50.3398895,36871,-4.14076281,50.3428917,36691,-4.13652706,50.3436203,36513,-4.13236523,50.3436317,36362,-4.13379478,50.3466415,36242,-4.13492012,50.3489494,36033,-4.13567781,50.352459,35855,-4.13631296,50.3555412,35703,-4.13695288,50.35783,35581,-4.13688898,50.3589783,35432,-4.13583899,50.3599815,35284,-4.13351679,50.3628197,35134,-4.13215017,50.3650284,34656,-4.13149977,50.3645782]},{"name":"ELFIDA","text":"ELFIDA:The page \"ELFIDA\" does not exist.

Despite the steep cliff paths and rocky surrounding, Bovisand features two beaches, a holiday park, privately owned bungalows and a diving centre at Fort Bovisand. The area, in the vicinity of Plymouth and Wembury, is used predominantly by locals, while tourists prefer the larger and better-known beaches elsewhere. It is often referred to as simply Bovi by locals. It lies just outside the boundaries of the city of Plymouth and instead within the district of South Hams.\nThere are two beaches at Bovisand, the first named Bovisand Bay is the Northern-most separated from the Southern-most, Crownhill Bay, by rocks and a grass bank, commonly known as \"Grassy\". Both beaches are accessible only by steps, and are served by a cafe and a small tourist shop, but have no lifeguards. During the summer months, Plymouth coach company Target Travel run an hourly bus, the number 54, to Bovisand via Staddon Heights, and so the bus stop is only accessible from the beach by steps.\nThe view from Bovisands includes Plymouth Breakwater, Mount Edgecumbe in Cornwall just across Plymouth Sound, and the English

character and structural properties accord perfectly with those thought desirable in a sonata finale of the early nineteenth century.\"[2] Carl Czerny (1791–1857) observed \"that first movements and finales ought to—and in practice actually do—proclaim their contrasted characters already in their opening themes.\"[3]\n\nIn theatrical music, Christoph Willibald Gluck was an early proponent of extended finales, with multiple characters, to support the \"increasingly natural and realistic\" stories in his operas that \"improved continuity and theatrical validity\" beyond the earlier works.[4]","path":[62770,-3.75932288,50.2432709,61270,-3.7593379,50.2432899,61152,-3.759413,50.2438316,60970,-3.75944805,50.2438698,60821,-3.75804496,50.2412987,60641,-3.76002192,50.2380219,60461,-3.7649169,50.2357483,60282,-3.767277,50.2340698,60103,-3.77111292,50.2308998,59922,-3.77484012,50.227829,59741,-3.7776401,50.2245903,59591,-3.77770209,50.2216682,59411,-3.77802801,50.2181702,59202,-3.77839494,50.2150917,58961,-3.77933192,50.2118988,58750,-3.78130507,50.2082214,58570,-3.78427005,50.2056389,58362,-3.78752708,50.2018814,58210,-3.79048705,50.199749,58031,-3.79780793,50.2012787,57852,-3.80510497,50.2032509,57730,-3.80999494,50.2049294,57581,-3.8161869,50.2063904,57341,-3.82706499,50.2085686,57191,-3.834337,50.2102699,57073,-3.84004498,50.2116508,56921,-3.84731197,50.2133904,56740,-3.85605502,50.2155113,56533,-3.8663981,50.2177887,56380,-3.874017,50.2198105,56230,-3.881037,50.2225113,56112,-3.8866899,50.2246017,55960,-3.89385009,50.2272415,55780,-3.90202498,50.2308311,55600,-3.91009998,50.234211,55455,-3.91663694,50.2368202,55301,-3.92383003,50.2394104,55123,-3.93230009,50.2422905,54971,-3.93930697,50.245079,54791,-3.94734502,50.2483902,54670,-3.95308709,50.2504807,54552,-3.95864201,50.2525291,54280,-3.97157311,50.2570496,54100,-3.98003697,50.2600708,53951,-3.98706007,50.2624702,53800,-3.99413991,50.2648697,53591,-4.00416183,50.2684593,53471,-4.00980997,50.2703896,53320,-4.01690102,50.2727814,53170,-4.023983,50.2751389,52990,-4.03239489,50.2780685,52841,-4.03940296,50.2803993,52630,-4.0492878,50.2836685,52511,-4.05490398,50.2854195,52330,-4.06353188,50.2878685,51852,-4.08691216,50.2943115,51731,-4.09316683,50.2959099,51612,-4.09928322,50.2976303,51490,-4.10540819,50.2993507,51311,-4.11425209,50.3018494,51131,-4.12274599,50.3048401,51010,-4.12849522,50.3070984,50860,-4.13499403,50.31036,50683,-4.1424799,50.3142319,50500,-4.14997816,50.3184013,50320,-4.1568799,50.3227386,50170,-4.16248512,50.3263397,49963,-4.16520596,50.33181,49782,-4.16620493,50.3365707,49600,-4.16540098,50.3407516,49421,-4.16258478,50.3435287,49240,-4.16049004,50.3470306,49062,-4.15964699,50.3508682,48881,-4.16424704,50.3548889,48731,-4.16860008,50.358181,48581,-4.17250776,50.3611984,48402,-4.17923784,50.3629112,48251,-4.184587,50.3644409,48100,-4.1879878,50.3672905,47891,-4.18954706,50.3719101,47710,-4.190135,50.375309,47590,-4.1900878,50.376339,47470,-4.19065523,50.3780594,47262,-4.19292498,50.3824615,47112,-4.19549179,50.3853989,46960,-4.19866514,50.3882408,46780,-4.20338821,50.3913002,46571,-4.20968723,50.3943214,46362,-4.21764278,50.3954201,45671,-4.24156284,50.3874702,45521,-4.24554682,50.3844604,45310,-4.25363016,50.382679,45191,-4.25826788,50.3820992,45041,-4.2637682,50.3812485,44861,-4.26809502,50.3779716,44710,-4.27209711,50.3757782,43631,-4.2720952,50.3756905,42371,-4.27223206,50.3756905,41110,-4.27227402,50.3756409,39850,-4.27229023,50.3756294,38560,-4.27231789,50.3756218,37273,-4.27244711,50.3755913,37150,-4.27241993,50.3754997,37000,-4.27098179,50.3764915,36790,-4.26766014,50.3791008,36583,-4.26276398,50.3815918,36431,-4.25834799,50.3824081,36281,-4.25399208,50.3826714,36130,-4.25010014,50.3833885,35920,-4.24408007,50.3850288,35740,-4.240201,50.3883896,35381,-4.23052502,50.3927307,35201,-4.2235918,50.3924484,34962,-4.22020721,50.3955917,34781,-4.21641779,50.3963585,34600,-4.21260214,50.3966904,34451,-4.20968485,50.3951607,34330,-4.20820713,50.3934593,34181,-4.20582485,50.3926582,34021,-4.19920206,50.3894005,33881,-4.19614315,50.3877602,33722,-4.19194317,50.3836098,33581,-4.19000292,50.3807182,33422,-4.18795204,50.3759003,33301,-4.18711519,50.3713799,33181,-4.18648291,50.3681412,33040,-4.18612289,50.3659592,32830,-4.17987823,50.3630409,32680,-4.17384005,50.3625412,32500,-4.16842508,50.3594589,32320,-4.16396999,50.3553505,32140,-4.16002989,50.3513908,31982,-4.15869999,50.3465881,31862,-4.15963221,50.3437195,31692,-4.16067791,50.3414917,31570,-4.16180706,50.3388214,31442,-4.16366005,50.3348312,31301,-4.16438484,50.3330002,31151,-4.16574287,50.3299713,31022,-4.16711521,50.3264885,30820,-4.16346216,50.3231888,30671,-4.15808821,50.3203583,30542,-4.15124702,50.3172798,30362,-4.14441776,50.3143997,30224,-4.1415329,50.3133011,30062,-4.13409281,50.3098907,29882,-4.12745714,50.3072701,29741,-4.12396002,50.3061218,29582,-4.1164732,50.3040085,29442,-4.11343002,50.303299,29282,-4.106194,50.30184,29161,-4.102782,50.302,28982,-4.098613,50.30237,28861,-4.095026,50.30309,28742,-4.090998,50.30441,28562,-4.087985,50.30807,28382,-4.082785,50.30978,28262,-4.07827,50.31004,28142,-4.07378,50.31033,28021,-4.070032,50.3099,27663,-4.062495,50.31273]},{"name":"NICOLA

He achieved distinction in the Spanish campaign of 1823, and became captain in 1825. In 1830 he entered the Royal Guard and was sent to North Africa, where he took part in the Mascara expedition. Promoted commandant in 1835, he distinguished himself under Marshal Clauzel in the campaign against Ahmed Pasha, bey of Constantine, and became lieutenant-colonel in 1837. The part he took in the, expedition of Portes-de-Fer gained him a colonelcy, and his success against the Hajutas and Kabyles, the cross of the Legion of Honour.\n\nThree more years of brilliant service in Africa won for him the rank of marechal de camp in 1840, and of lieutenant-general in 1843. In 1847 he held the Algiers divisional command. He visited France early in 1848, assisted the provisional government to establish order, and returned to Africa in May to succeed General Cavaignac in the government of French Algeria. He was speedily recalled on his election to the general assembly for the Seine département, and received the command of the National Guard of Paris, to which was added soon afterwards that of the troops in Paris, altogether nearly 100,000 men. He held a high place and exercised great influence in the complicated politics of the next two years (for much more on Changarnier's activities during this time, see Karl Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte).\nChangarnier ran for president in the election of 1848, but came in dead last with less than ten thousand votes out of ten times that many.\nChangarnier in later life.\nIn 1849 Changarnier received the grand cross of the Legion of Honour. An avowed enemy of republican institutions, he held a unique position in upholding the power of the president; but in January 1851 he opposed Louis Napoleon's policy, was in consequence deprived of his double command, and at the coup d'état in December was arrested and sent to Mazas, until his banishment from France by the decree of January 9, 1852.\n\nChangarnier returned to France after the general amnesty, and resided in his estate in the department of Saône-et-Loire. At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he held no command, but was present with the headquarters, and afterwards with Bazaine in Metz. He was employed on an unsuccessful mission to Prince Frederick Charles, commanding the German army which besieged Metz, and on the capitulation became a prisoner of war. At the armistice he returned to Paris, and in 1871 was elected to the National Assembly by four departments, and sat for the Somme. He took an active part in politics, defended the conduct of Marshal Bazaine, and served on the committee which elaborated the monarchical constitution. When the comte de Chambord refused the compromise, he moved the resolution to extend the executive power for ten years to Marshal MacMahon.

His ship, the Revenge, met 53 Spanish war ships near Flores in the Azores. He and his crew fought the fifty three in a three-day running battle. Many Spanish ships were sunk or so badly damaged that they had to retire from the battle. The Revenge was boarded three times and each time the boarders were seen off. Grenville was also a soldier, an armed merchant fleet owner, privateer, colonizer, and explorer. He took part in the early English attempts to settle the New World, and also participated in the fight against the Spanish Armada.

(/ˈbɛkwiː/ or /ˈbɛkweɪ/) is the second largest island in the Grenadines at 7 square miles (18 km2) (the largest being Carriacou, a dependency of Grenada). It is part of the country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and is approximately 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the nation's capital, Kingstown, on the main island, Saint Vincent. Bequia means \"island of the clouds\" in the ancient Arawak. The island's name was also 'Becouya' as part of the Granadilles. The island's unofficial anthem is considered to be 'Only in Bequia' by island native Raphael \"Socony\" Holder.Bequia is a small island, measuring 7 square miles (18 km2) with a population of approximately 4,300. The native population are primarily a mixture of people of African, Scottish and Island Carib descent. A substantial number of white Barbadians also settled the Mount Pleasant area of Bequia in the 1860s. Many of their descendants still inhabit the area. Other highly populated areas include the island capital, Port Elizabeth, which hosts the ferry terminal and Paget Farm, which hosts the airport. There are also villages at Lower Bay, La Pompe, Hamilton and Belmont. Other prominent areas of Bequia include Spring, the site of a former coconut plantation and home to agricultural animals, Industry Bay and Park Bay, where the Old Hegg Turtle Sanctuary is located.The island's hills are much lower than the peaks of St. Vincent, 10 miles (16 km) to the north, so they do not receive as many rain showers.Princess Margaret, who had a home on nearby Mustique, visited Bequia and had a beach named in her honour. Princess Margaret Beach is next to Port Elizabeth and is situated inside Admiralty Bay on the west coast. Also on the west coast are the island's main port and a large natural harbour.Bequia is popular among cruising yachts, expats and tourists. One of the busiest times of the year is the annual Easter Regatta.Two scuba diving stores run dive trips to 28 identified dive sites around Bequia. There are several wrecks and shallow caves accessible to advanced divers. It is not unusual to see Hawksbill turtles, lobsters, moray eels and many kinds of fish when diving around Bequia.As a result of the Treaty of Utrecht, which brought an end to the War of Spanish Succession and established peace between the Spanish and British Empires, Great Britain obtained the lucrative monopoly over the Asiento slave trade. Runaway and shipwrecked slaves inhabited the island of St. Vincent in the 17th century. According to an early account of the French West Indies, which considered Bequia as part of Grenada, Bequia was too inaccessible to colonize and Caribs and Arawaks used the island for fishing and farming. A few Portuguese and Dutch slave ships en route to Sint Eustatius from West Africa reportedly shipwrecked on the Grenadine reefs.Bequia was under French control in the 18th century and during the Seven Years' War with England, the island was used by the fleets of their Spanish and Dutch allies to take on supplies, while British ships were banned. The Treaty of Paris (1763) produced a significant re-alignment in the map of the Caribbean; St. Vincent and the Grenadine islands, including Grenada, were given to the British in exchange for Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Lucia. The name Petit Martinique comes from this era, as does Petit Saint Vincent. In 1779 the French seized the island, despite the Treaty of Paris, but were forced to relinquish control to Britain again soon after.The early 18th century saw the development of a sugar industry and the production of related products including molasses and rum. Other major produce included coffee, indigo and arrowroot. At one point in time, the islands of St. Vincent and the Grenadines were the single largest producer of arrowroot starch in the world. Currently, Hairoun and Vincy strong rum are major export products primarily to the European Union.Under a programme instituted by Great Britain to give land to indigent settlers James Hamilton, father of Alexander Hamilton, moved from St. Croix to Bequia in 1774 where he remained until 1790. The land granted to Hamilton lies along the shore of Southeast Bay. Despite his son's frequent gifts of money and entreaties to immigrate or at least visit him, neither visited the other.[1]Some historians believe that the famous pirate Edward Teach had his base in Bequia. The opening shot of the movie Blackbeard, Pirate of the Caribbean, made by the BBC, displays a replica of his first ship off the coast of Bequia in the St. Vincent passage. According to local legend, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was not only Captain Edward Teach's base, but also the place from which Sir Francis Drake planned his attacks on the Spanish admiralty in Don Blas de Lezo's Cartagena. Indeed, it is thought that Henry Morgan may also have anchored in Admiralty Bay as it was then the safest natural harbour in the Eastern Caribbean during hurricane season. Bequia was used as a repair facility for ships. Beside Nelson's Dockyard on Antigua, and the Carlyle in Bridgetown, Barbados, there were no other drydocks or shipyards in the area. Wooden shipbuilding and ship-repair on Bequia was possible due to the presence of Cedar trees on the island and a sufficiently deep and sheltered harbour.Bequia is one of the few places in the world where limited whaling is still allowed by the International Whaling Commission.[2] Natives of Bequia are allowed to catch up to four humpback whales per year using only traditional hunting methods of hand-thrown harpoons in small, open sailboats. The limit is rarely met, with no catch some years.[3] Bequia has a long tradition of whaling as well as the building of whaling boats.[3][4] There is a small whaling museum on the island chronicling local whaling's history. A feature of the Port Elizabeth waterfront is the Whale Boner Bar & Restaurant. This bar has an entrance onto the beach consisting of an arch of two whale ribs, as well as whale vertebrae mounted on the bar seats and a whale rib running the length of the bar.In the 2012 meeting of the International Whaling Commission, the delegates renewed the annual quota of whales for all three groups who submitted joint bids: Alaskan Inupiat, Russian indigenous people in Chukotka in eastern Siberia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines, despite protestations of delegates from Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Chile, and Costa Rica.[2] Dominican Republic delegate Peter Sanchez said the St Vincent and the Grenadines hunt was \"artisanal whaling out of control,\" and that the hunters have \"repeatedly broken the rules - hunting for young ones and pregnant females.\"[2] Other delegates pointed out that St Vincent and the Grenadines bid \"should not qualify under ASW rules because the Bequians, the group that maintains the hunt, are not truly indigenous.\"[2]Monaco delegate Frederic Briand argued that whaling \"started by a settler's family as recently as 1875 does not qualify as 'aboriginal'.\"[2] Louise Mitchell Joseph, speaking on behalf of the Eastern Caribbean Coalition of Environmental Awareness stated that there was no documented history of whaling in the islands, and that \"there have been many archaeological excavations conducted, and there was no evidence found whatsoever of whale hunting by aboriginal peoples. Neither whale remains nor weapons that could have been used to kill such a large mammals were ever found; neither are any images of whales inscribed on our petroglyphs.\"[2]Erected in 1992, the James F. Mitchell International Airport for small planes is located near Paget Farm. With a runway length of 3,609 feet (1,100 metres), Bequia can be reached by plane with daily connections from Kingstown, Bridgetown and surrounding islands.Regularly scheduled ferries run from the main island of Saint Vincent. Three ferries operate between the capital, Kingstown, and the local port of Port Elizabeth. The other islands in the Grenadines can be reached by the last operational schooner in the Caribbean, the antique original Bequia-built SS Friendship Rose, based in Port Elizabeth. The Friendship Rose is often used by the local Bequia football teams to sail to the other islands for matches. The ferry offers daytime as well as overnight charters, and onboard picnics are locally renowned.The ferry pier is located 15 minutes from E.T. Joshua Airport and is served by two companies, Bequia Express and Admiralty Transport. Bequia Express uses a family-owned ferry that is 148 feet (45 m) long with a cargo space measuring 4,440 square feet (412 m2) of which 3,000 square feet (280 m2) is sheltered with a 14-foot (4.3 m) ceiling. The approximate capacity of the ship is 28 cars or 10 - 20 containers and is licensed for 400 passengers. The Admiral II is a similarly sized vessel with a capacity for 250 passengers. Travellers on the Admiral II have a choice between air-conditioned indoor seating or covered outdoor seating. The passage between Kingstown and Port Elizabeth is a 9-mile (14 km) trip taking approximately one hour.Pedestrians such as hitchhikers and backpackers have the option of the Grenadines mail boat which travels to Port Elizabeth at irregular intervals. The mail boat calls at Canouan, Mayreau and Union islands although boarding at Mayreau can be difficult, as the vessel remains in deeper waters, with passengers being required to embark and leave through the use of smaller craft, which land on the nearby beach.The island has a variety of communication systems including standard telephone and fax lines, a mobile network, and internet access. The old telex system still operates. Bequia has its own heavy-duty long-range shortwave radio antenna. Many inhabitants use the marine VHF radio system on channel 68 for local communication.Considering the size of the island, Bequia has a large publications industry. Various publishers, editors, and writers work on the island, as do painters and graphic designers.Coordinates: 13°00′N 61°13′W﻿ / ﻿13.000°N 61.217°W﻿ / 13.000; -61.217","path":[50659,-4.16728497,50.3634911,50539,-4.16740799,50.3634109,50417,-4.16713285,50.362011,50298,-4.16799212,50.3597984,50088,-4.16663313,50.3566704,49912,-4.16394997,50.354599,49757,-4.161695,50.3526917,49577,-4.15924501,50.3503685,49400,-4.16087484,50.3474884,49277,-4.16330481,50.3455086,49129,-4.16662216,50.3430405,48978,-4.17040777,50.3407707,48798,-4.17592096,50.338459,48647,-4.18087292,50.3366508,48467,-4.18559599,50.3339882,48290,-4.19107008,50.3316116,48139,-4.19608212,50.3305206,47959,-4.19773722,50.3309708,47601,-4.19755316,50.3309898,46340,-4.19754982,50.3309097,45079,-4.19755507,50.3309097,44900,-4.19752598,50.3309402,44719,-4.19751596,50.3309212,44539,-4.19753313,50.3309212,44180,-4.19751787,50.3309402,42740,-4.19755316,50.3309212,42559,-4.19752598,50.3310013,42380,-4.19754314,50.3310013,41119,-4.19756699,50.3310394,39859,-4.19756317,50.3309517,38623,-4.19663811,50.3314095,38444,-4.19300699,50.3316383,38264,-4.1873579,50.3320198,38083,-4.18298292,50.3351707,37933,-4.17863703,50.3372993,37783,-4.17393684,50.3390503,37604,-4.16874599,50.3413391,37453,-4.16496277,50.3434296,37243,-4.16053486,50.3464088,37035,-4.1600399,50.3512802,36884,-4.16371822,50.3544807,36703,-4.16756678,50.3585014,36552,-4.16762781,50.3622589,35891,-4.16731215,50.3634987]},{"name":"GRAYHOUND","text":"GRAYHOUND:The Greyhound is a breed of dog; a sighthound which has been bred for coursing game and Greyhound racing. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.According to Merriam-Webster, a Greyhound is \"any of a breed of tall slender graceful smooth-coated dogs characterized by swiftness and keen sight\", as well as \"any of several related dogs,\" such as the Italian Greyhound.[2]It is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph).[3][4][5] The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.[6][7]Males are usually 71 to 76 centimetres (28 to 30 in) tall at the withers, and weigh around 27 to 40 kilograms (60 to 88 lb). Females tend to be smaller, with shoulder heights ranging from 68 to 71 centimetres (27 to 28 in) and weights from less than 27 to 34 kilograms (60 to 75 lb). Greyhounds have very short fur, which is easy to maintain. There are approximately thirty recognized color forms, of which variations of white, brindle, fawn, black, red and blue (gray) can appear uniquely or in combination.[8] Greyhounds are dolichocephalic, with a skull which is relatively long in comparison to its breadth, and an elongated muzzle.Greyhounds can be aloof and indifferent to strangers, but are affectionate with their own pack. They are generally docile, lazy, easy-going, and calm.Greyhounds wear muzzles during racing, which can lead some to believe they are aggressive dogs, but this is not true. Muzzles are worn to prevent injuries resulting from dogs nipping one another during or immediately after a race, when the 'hare' has disappeared out of sight and the dogs are no longer racing but remain excited.Contrary to popular belief, adult Greyhounds do not need extended periods of daily exercise, as they are bred for sprinting rather than endurance. Greyhound puppies that have not been taught how to utilize their energy, however, can be hyperactive and destructive if not given an outlet, and therefore require more experienced handlers.[9]Greyhound owners and adoption groups consider Greyhounds wonderful pets.[10] Greyhounds are quiet, gentle and loyal to owners. They are very loving, and enjoy the company of their humans and other dogs. Whether a Greyhound will enjoy the company of other small animals, such as cats, depends on the individual dog's personality. Greyhounds will typically chase small animals; those lacking a high 'prey drive' will be able to coexist happily with toy dog breeds and/or cats. Many owners describe their Greyhounds as \"45-mile-per-hour couch potatoes\".[11]Greyhounds live most happily as pets in quiet environments.[12] They do well in families with children, as long as the children are taught to treat the dog properly with politeness and appropriate respect.[13] Greyhounds have a sensitive nature, and gentle commands work best as training methods.[14]Occasionally, a Greyhound may bark; however, Greyhounds are generally not barkers, which is beneficial in suburban environments, and are usually as friendly to strangers as they are with their own families.[15]A very common misconception regarding Greyhounds is that they are hyperactive. This is usually not the case with retired racing Greyhounds.[16] Greyhounds can live comfortably as apartment dogs, as they do not require much space and sleep almost 18 hours per day. Due to their calm temperament, Greyhounds can make better \"apartment dogs\" than smaller, more active breeds.At most race tracks, Greyhounds are housed in crates. Most such animals know nothing other than being in a crate for the majority of the day. Therefore, crate training a retired Greyhound in a home is generally easy.Many Greyhound adoption groups recommend that owners keep their Greyhounds on a lead whenever outdoors, except in fully enclosed areas.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] This is due to their prey-drive, their speed, and the assertion that Greyhounds have no road sense.[25] In some jurisdictions, it is illegal for Greyhounds to be allowed off-lead[26] even in off-lead dog parks. Due to their size and strength, adoption groups recommend that fences be between 4 and 6 feet tall, to prevent Greyhounds from jumping over them.[17]The original primary use of Greyhounds, both in the British Isles and on the Continent of Europe, was in the coursing of deer. Later, they specialized in competition hare coursing.[27] Some Greyhounds are still used for coursing, although artificial lure sports like lure coursing and racing are far more common and popular. Many leading 300- to 550-yard sprinters have bloodlines traceable back through Irish sires, within a few generations of racers that won events such as the Irish Coursing Derby or the Irish Cup.[28][29]Until the early twentieth century, Greyhounds were principally bred and trained for hunting and coursing. During the 1920s, modern greyhound racing was introduced into the United States and England (Belle Vue Stadium, Manchester, July 1926), as well as Northern Ireland (Celtic Park (Belfast), April 1927) and the Republic of Ireland (Shelbourne Park, Dublin).[citation needed]Australia also has a significant racing culture.[30][31][32] However, the 2015 live baiting scandal and adverse media coverage led to a Special Commission of Inquiry into the Greyhound Racing Industry in NSW.[33] On 7 July 2016, New South Wales Premier Mike Baird announced that greyhound racing was to be banned in the state from 1 July 2017 after the inquiry found evidence of systemic animal cruelty, including mass greyhound killings and live baiting,[33][34][35] however the plan for the ban was later reversed before it was implemented.[36][37][38] After the NSW announcement to ban racing, Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Chief Minister Andrew Barr stated that greyhound racing would be banned in the ACT.[39]Aside from professional racing, many Greyhounds enjoy success on the amateur race track. Organizations like the Large Gazehound Racing Association (LGRA) and the National Oval Track Racing Association (NOTRA) provide opportunities for Greyhounds and other sighthound breeds to compete in amateur racing events all over the United States.[40][41]Greyhounds can squeeze into very narrow spaces[42] and are strong jumpers.[43]Greyhounds cope well as three-legged dogs.[44]Historically, the Greyhound has, since its first appearance as a hunting type and breed, enjoyed a specific degree of fame and definition in Western literature, heraldry and art as the most elegant or noble companion and hunter of the canine world. In modern times, the professional racing industry, with its large numbers of track-bred Greyhounds, as well as international adoption programs aimed at rescuing and re-homing dogs that were at a surplus to the industry. They have redefined the breed in their almost mutually dependent pursuit of its welfare- as a sporting dog that will supply friendly companionship in its retirement.[45] Outside the racing industry and coursing community, the Kennel Clubs' registered breed still enjoys a modest following as a show dog and pet. There is an emerging pattern visible in recent years (2009–2010) of a significant decline in track betting and multiple track closures in the US, which will have consequences for the origin of future companion Greyhounds and the re-homing of current ex-racers.[46][47]Greyhounds are typically a healthy and long-lived breed, and hereditary illness is rare. Some Greyhounds have been known to develop esophageal achalasia, gastric dilatation volvulus (also known as bloat), and osteosarcoma. If exposed to E. coli, they may develop Alabama rot. Because the Greyhound's lean physique makes it ill-suited to sleeping on hard surfaces, owners of both racing and companion Greyhounds generally provide soft bedding; without bedding, Greyhounds are prone to develop painful skin sores. The average lifespan of a Greyhound is 9 to 11 years.[48][49]Due to the Greyhound's unique physiology and anatomy, a veterinarian who understands the issues relevant to the breed is generally needed when the dogs need treatment, particularly when anesthesia is required. Greyhounds cannot metabolize barbiturate-based anesthesia in the same way that other breeds can because their livers have lower amounts of oxidative enzymes.[50] Greyhounds demonstrate unusual blood chemistry [1], which can be misread by veterinarians not familiar with the breed and can result in an incorrect diagnosis.[51]Greyhounds are very sensitive to insecticides.[52] Many vets do not recommend the use of flea collars or flea spray on Greyhounds if the product is a pyrethrin-based. Products like Advantage, Frontline, Lufenuron, and Amitraz are safe for use on Greyhounds, however, and are very effective in controlling fleas and ticks.[53]Greyhounds have higher levels of red blood cells than other breeds. Since red blood cells carry oxygen to the muscles, this higher level allows the hound to move larger quantities of oxygen faster from the lungs to the muscles.[54] Conversely, Greyhounds have lower levels of platelets than other breeds.[55] Veterinary blood services often use Greyhounds as universal blood donors.[56]Greyhounds do not have undercoats and thus are less likely to trigger dog allergies in humans (they are sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"hypoallergenic\"). The lack of an undercoat, coupled with a general lack of body fat, also makes Greyhounds more susceptible to extreme temperatures (both hot and cold); because of this, they must be housed inside.[57]The key to the speed of a Greyhound can be found in its light but muscular build, large heart, highest percentage of fast-twitch muscle of any breed,[58][59] double suspension gallop, and extreme flexibility of its spine. \"Double suspension rotary gallop\" describes the fastest running gait of the Greyhound in which all four feet are free from the ground in two phases, contracted and extended, during each full stride.[60]The breed's origin has in popular literature often been romantically connected to Ancient Egypt, in which it is believed \"that the breed dates back about 4,000 years;\"[61][62] a belief for which there is no scientific evidence. While similar in appearance to Saluki (Persian Greyhound) or Sloughi (tombs at Beni Hassan c. 2000 BC), analyses of DNA reported in 2004 suggest that the Greyhound may not be closely related to these breeds, but is a close relative of herding dogs.[63][64] Historical literature on the first sighthound in Europe (Arrian), the vertragus, probable antecedent of the Greyhound, suggests that its origin lies with the ancient Celts from Eastern Europe or Eurasia. Greyhound-type dogs of small, medium, and large size, appear to have been bred across Europe since that time. All modern, pure-bred pedigree Greyhounds derive from the Greyhound stock recorded and registered first in private studbooks in the 18th century, then in public studbooks in the 19th century, which ultimately were registered with coursing, racing, and kennel club authorities of the United Kingdom.Historically, these sighthounds were used primarily for hunting in the open where their keen eyesight was valuable. It is believed that they (or at least similarly named dogs) were introduced to the British Isles in the 5th and 6th century BC from Celtic mainland Europe, although the Picts and other peoples of the northern British Isles (modern Scotland) were believed to have had large hounds similar to that of the deerhound before the 6th century BC.[citation needed]The name \"Greyhound\" is generally believed to come from the Old English grighund. \"Hund\" is the antecedent of the modern \"hound\", but the meaning of \"grig\" is undetermined, other than in reference to dogs in Old English and Old Norse. Its origin does not appear to have any common root with the modern word \"grey\"[65] for color, and indeed the Greyhound is seen with a wide variety of coat colors. The lighter colors, patch-like markings and white appeared in the breed that was once ordinarily grey in color. The Greyhound is the only dog mentioned by name in the Bible; many versions, including the King James version, name the Greyhound as one of the \"four things stately\" in the Proverbs.[66] However, some newer biblical translations, including The New International Version, have changed this to strutting rooster, which appears to be an alternative translation of the Hebrew term mothen zarzir. However, the Douay–Rheims Bible translation from the late 4th-century Latin Vulgate into English translates this term as \"a cock.\"According to Pokorny[67] the English name \"Greyhound\" does not mean \"grey dog/hound\", but simply \"fair dog\". Subsequent words have been derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *g'her- \"shine, twinkle\": English grey, Old High German gris \"grey, old,\" Old Icelandic griss \"piglet, pig,\" Old Icelandic gryja \"to dawn,\" gryjandi \"morning twilight,\" Old Irish grian \"sun,\" Old Church Slavonic zorja \"morning twilight, brightness.\" The common sense of these words is \"to shine; bright.\"In 1928, the first winner of Best in Show at Crufts was Primley Sceptre, a Greyhound owned by H. Whitley.[68]","path":[69084,-4.18763208,50.3143883,68934,-4.18548298,50.315361,68725,-4.18463182,50.3185616,68607,-4.185256,50.3209915,68427,-4.18670797,50.3248711,48414,-4.18688011,50.3317604,47995,-4.17906284,50.3350105,47755,-4.17478704,50.3367386,47514,-4.17108202,50.3385315,47365,-4.16868019,50.33955,47247,-4.16666508,50.3403587,47095,-4.16418219,50.3418808,46884,-4.16124487,50.3443718,46705,-4.1593318,50.346611,46525,-4.1589632,50.3496704,46375,-4.16133404,50.3526917,46224,-4.164505,50.3558617,46047,-4.16850185,50.3597107,45925,-4.16851711,50.3621597,44845,-4.16768789,50.3628311,43584,-4.16769218,50.3628197,42324,-4.1676898,50.3628197,41064,-4.16767979,50.3628311,39806,-4.16769218,50.3628311,38544,-4.16770792,50.3628311,37285,-4.16771793,50.3628311,36025,-4.16770792,50.3628311,34766,-4.16771317,50.3628311,33504,-4.16770315,50.3628311,32065,-4.16771317,50.3628311,30804,-4.16771221,50.3628387,29545,-4.16772509,50.3628502,28285,-4.16771793,50.3628387,27025,-4.16771984,50.3628311,25764,-4.16771698,50.3628311,24504,-4.16770315,50.3628311,23245,-4.16769791,50.3628311,21984,-4.16768599,50.3628311,20725,-4.1677022,50.3628311,19465,-4.16769981,50.3628311,18205,-4.16769505,50.3628311,16944,-4.16767216,50.3628311,15684,-4.16767216,50.3628502,14424,-4.16768217,50.3628311,13164,-4.16768599,50.3628311,11905,-4.16769505,50.3628387,10644,-4.16769505,50.3628197,9384,-4.16769981,50.3628311,8124,-4.16768599,50.3628311,6864,-4.16769505,50.3628311,5605,-4.16767502,50.3628311,4345,-4.16768312,50.3628311,3084,-4.16767979,50.3628311,1824,-4.16765785,50.3628197,564,-4.16769505,50.3628311]},{"name":"AUTONAUT ISLAY","text":"AUTONAUT ISLAY:Criticism of Islam has existed since its formative stages.

Other criticism focuses on the question of human rights in the Islamic world historically and in modern Islamic nations, including the treatment of women, LGBT people and religious and ethnic minorities in Islamic law and practice.[8][9][9] In the wake of the recent multiculturalism trend, Islam's influence on the ability or willingness of Muslim immigrants to assimilate in the Western world,[10] and other countries such as India[11][12][13] and Russia,[14][15] has been criticized.Early Islam[edit]John of Damascus a Syrian monk and presbyter, 19th-century Arabic icon.

The second chapter of his book, The Fount of Wisdom, titled \"Concerning Heresies\", presents a series of discussions between Christians and Muslims. John claimed an Arian monk (whom he did not know was Bahira) influenced Muhammad and viewed the Islamic doctrines as nothing more than a hodgepodge culled from the Bible. Writing on Islam's claim of Abrahamic ancestry, John explained that the Arabs were called \"Saracens\" (Greek Σαρακενοί, Sarakenoi) because they were \"empty\" (κενός, kenos, in Greek) \"of Sarah\".

The ship saw service before and during World War II, seeing service on Russian, Malta and Atlantic convoys.Description[edit]\nThe E-class ships were slightly improved versions of the preceding D class. They displaced 1,405 long tons (1,428 t) at standard load and 1,940 long tons (1,970 t) at deep load. The ships had an overall length of 329 feet (100.3 m), a beam of 33 feet 3 inches (10.1 m) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches (3.8 m). They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of 36,000 shaft horsepower (27,000 kW) and gave a maximum speed of 35.5 knots (65.7 km/h; 40.9 mph). Escapade carried a maximum of 470 long tons (480 t) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 6,350 nautical miles (11,760 km; 7,310 mi) at 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph). The ships' complement was 145 officers and ratings.The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the Vickers 0.5 in (12.7 mm) AA machinegun. The E class was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedoes.[2] One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.Wartime modifications[edit] Escapade had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder (76 mm) AA gun by April 1941. In June–September 1943, she was converted into an escort destroyer. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar was fitted and a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge, replacing the director-control tower and rangefinder. Her short-range AA armament was augmented by four 20 mm (0.8 in) Oerlikon guns and the .50-calibre machine guns were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons. A split Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar was installed abreast 'B' gun and stowage for a total of 70 depth charges meant that 'Y' gun and the 12-pounder had to be removed to compensate for their weight.[4]\n\nAfter the accident that destroyed her Hedgehog mount in September 1943, the ship was required extensive repairs and the navy took the opportunity to install two new Squid mounts in lieu of 'A' gun. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast and a Type 277 radar replaced the Type 271 and the Type 286 was superseded by a Type 291 radar.[5]Construction and career[edit]\nEscapade, the only ship of that name to serve with the Royal Navy,[6] was ordered 1 November 1932, from Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company under the 1931 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 30 March 1932 at their Greenock dockyard, and launched on 30 January 1934. The ship was commissioned on 30 August 1934, at a total cost of £249,987, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament.[7] Escapade and her sister ships were assigned to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) and accompanied the Home Fleet during its West Indies cruise between January and March 1935. She collided with her sister Encounter off Portland on 18 June, but was only lightly damaged. The ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of the rest of her flotilla, beginning in September 1935, during the Abyssinian Crisis, returning home with the rest of her sisters in March 1936. The flotilla patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War, enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee, Escapade being detached for this duty five times between January 1937 and March 1939. She was struck by one of her sisters, Eclipse, on 18 January when her engines broke down and Eclipse could not manoeuver clear in time; repairs took 17 days to complete. The ship was placed in reserve on 16 June at Devonport, but was recommissioned on 2 August to participate in the Reserve Fleet Review three days later.","path":[49823,-4.12271976,50.3583298,49703,-4.12245798,50.3585014,49583,-4.12172985,50.3594398,49315,-4.1174469,50.36063,49104,-4.11938715,50.3604889,48953,-4.12296677,50.3610611,48715,-4.12906599,50.3629303,48563,-4.13390779,50.3614197,48414,-4.13650179,50.3582687,48263,-4.13602018,50.3544197,48084,-4.13587284,50.350029,47937,-4.13647509,50.3470993,47783,-4.13676786,50.3450813,47665,-4.1357069,50.3464317,47513,-4.13378477,50.3469086,47304,-4.13307524,50.3430405,47153,-4.13362217,50.3393211,46944,-4.13416481,50.3338699,46794,-4.13334179,50.3296089,46614,-4.13260984,50.3246117,46434,-4.13136292,50.3196411,46284,-4.12950706,50.3152504,46164,-4.12775517,50.3119392,46015,-4.12449312,50.30793,45833,-4.11930704,50.3036308,45626,-4.11242199,50.2996788,45414,-4.10491705,50.2967415,45263,-4.09959316,50.294899,45145,-4.09540701,50.2935715,44994,-4.08993101,50.2918205,44723,-4.07981205,50.288681,44606,-4.07535315,50.2873611,44483,-4.0707798,50.2859306,44334,-4.06504011,50.2842789,44153,-4.05854321,50.2823792,44005,-4.05317402,50.2807007,43883,-4.04872322,50.2793312,43704,-4.04238796,50.2768898,43525,-4.0360918,50.2749481,43385,-4.02978706,50.2731514,43194,-4.02444983,50.2715492,43044,-4.01903296,50.2698593,42834,-4.0113349,50.2674217,42683,-4.00581789,50.2657089,42445,-3.99685502,50.2629204,42264,-3.99029803,50.2607498,42144,-3.98610711,50.2593803,42024,-3.98193002,50.2579803,41814,-3.97450209,50.2555084,41663,-3.96878195,50.2538109,41485,-3.96223807,50.2518082,41303,-3.95526505,50.2497101,41123,-3.94864798,50.2476807,40945,-3.94205809,50.2457504,40793,-3.9366231,50.2441597,40585,-3.92930293,50.2420082,40434,-3.92389297,50.2403297,40283,-3.91847706,50.2386398,40165,-3.91431999,50.2372284,40013,-3.90901709,50.2353401,39803,-3.90120006,50.2324905,39624,-3.89427209,50.2301216,39443,-3.88747191,50.2278709,39325,-3.88318992,50.2264519,39205,-3.878968,50.2249184,39023,-3.87228489,50.2227211,38844,-3.86572194,50.2207184,38695,-3.86023498,50.2188301,38546,-3.85487294,50.2169304,38364,-3.84861803,50.2147293,38247,-3.845083,50.213459,38124,-3.84113312,50.2121391,37975,-3.83702993,50.2107811,37734,-3.82989311,50.2088089,37583,-3.82612991,50.2077789,37403,-3.82125807,50.2064095,37194,-3.81545305,50.2047691,37044,-3.81152511,50.2037086,36894,-3.80735302,50.2026596,36714,-3.80287695,50.2014694,36538,-3.79892302,50.2005997,36296,-3.79173207,50.2000389,36114,-3.78699994,50.2013206,35964,-3.78432202,50.2031097,35784,-3.7810719,50.2050018,35577,-3.777807,50.2079086,35397,-3.7780869,50.2113914,35244,-3.778337,50.2145386,35095,-3.77930307,50.2177582,34915,-3.77964711,50.2217293,34764,-3.77830195,50.2247887,34585,-3.77608991,50.2275581,34374,-3.77267194,50.2298203,34226,-3.77034712,50.2317085,34013,-3.76679301,50.2344398,33773,-3.76282811,50.2372284,32637,-3.76208496,50.2375603]},{"name":"FENG SHUI","text":"FENG SHUI:Feng shui or fengshui (pinyin: fēngshuǐ, pronounced [fə́ŋ.ʂwèi] ( listen)) is a Chinese philosophical system of harmonizing everyone with the surrounding environment. It is closely linked to Taoism. The term feng shui literally translates as \"wind-water\" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost Classic of Burial recorded in Guo Pu's commentary:[1] Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as physiognomy (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in metaphoric terms of \"invisible forces\" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as qi.There is no replicable scientific evidence that feng shui's mystical claims are real, and it is considered by the scientific community to be pseudoscience.Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an auspicious manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, stars, or a compass.Qi rides the wind and scatters, but is retained when encountering water.[1]Feng shui was suppressed in mainland China during the state-imposed Cultural Revolution of the 1960s but has since then regained popularity.The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience briefly summarizes the history and practice of feng shui. It states that the principles of feng shui related to living harmoniously with nature are \"quite rational,\" but does not otherwise lend credibility to the nonscientific claims.[2][3] After a comprehensive 2016 evaluation of the subject by scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning, he concluded that there is nothing demonstrably real at all about the practice and stated that:There's no real science behind feng shui... It's also a simple matter to dismiss the mystical energies said to be at its core; they simply don't exist.[4]As of 2013[update] the Yangshao and Hongshan cultures provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the magnetic compass, feng shui apparently relied on astronomy to find correlations between humans and the universe.[5] In 4000 BC, the doors of Banpo dwellings aligned with the asterism Yingshi just after the winter solstice—this sited the homes for solar gain.[6] During the Zhou era, Yingshi was known as Ding and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the Shijing. The late Yangshao site at Dadiwan (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north-south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.[7]A grave at Puyang (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— actually a Chinese star map of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and Beidou (the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel)— is oriented along a north-south axis.[8] The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,[9] suggests that gaitian cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the Zhoubi Suanjing.[10]Cosmography that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist Li Xueqin links the design to the liuren astrolabe, zhinan zhen, and luopan.[11]Beginning with palatial structures at Erlitou,[12] all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the Kaogong ji (simplified Chinese: 考工记; traditional Chinese: 考工記; \"Manual of Crafts\") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual Lu ban jing (simplified Chinese: 鲁班经; traditional Chinese: 魯班經; \"Lu ban's manuscript\") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from Puyang to Mawangdui and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.The history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years[13] before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in Chinese astronomy.[14] Some current techniques can be traced to Neolithic China,[15] while others were added later (most notably the Han dynasty, the Tang, the Song, and the Ming).[16]The astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the Zhouli, the original feng shui instrument may have been a gnomon. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north-south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at Xiaotun lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as Paul Wheatley observed,[17] they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at Yanshi and Zhengzhou. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.[18]The oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are liuren astrolabes, also known as shi. These consist of a lacquered, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for Da Liu Ren[19] the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of Taiyi through the nine palaces.[20] The markings on a liuren/shi and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.[21]The magnetic compass was invented for feng shui[22] and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the Luopan or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 zhinan zhen)—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.The goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good qi. The \"perfect spot\" is a location and an axis in time.[23][24]Qi（氣）(pronounced \"chee\" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui.[26] In feng shui as in Chinese martial arts, it refers to 'energy', in the sense of 'life force' or élan vital. A traditional explanation of qi as it relates to feng shui would include the orientation of a structure, its age, and its interaction with the surrounding environment, including the local microclimates, the slope of the land, vegetation, and soil quality.[citation needed]The Book of Burial says that burial takes advantage of \"vital qi\". Wu Yuanyin[27] (Qing dynasty) said that vital qi was \"congealed qi\", which is the state of qi that engenders life. The goal of feng shui is to take advantage of vital qi by appropriate siting of graves and structures.[24] Some people destroyed graveyards of their enemies to weaken their qi.[28][29][30][31][32]One use for a loupan is to detect the flow of qi.[33][citation needed] Magnetic compasses reflect local geomagnetism which includes geomagnetically induced currents caused by space weather.[34] Professor Max Knoll suggested in a 1951 lecture that qi is a form of solar radiation.[35] As space weather changes over time,[36] and the quality of qi rises and falls over time,[24] feng shui with a compass might be considered a form of divination that assesses the quality of the local environment—including the effects of space weather. Often people with good karma live in land with good qi.[37][38][39][40]Polarity is expressed in feng shui as yin and yang theory. Polarity expressed through yin and yang is similar to a magnetic dipole. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. Yang acting and yin receiving could be considered an early understanding of chirality.[clarification needed] The development of this theory and its corollary, five phase theory (five element theory), have also been linked with astronomical observations of sunspots.[41]The Five Elements or Forces (wu xing) – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic Book of History. They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life.[42] Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other.[citation needed] While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.[43]Two diagrams known as bagua (or pa kua) loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the Yijing (or I Ching).[citation needed] The Lo (River) Chart (Luoshu) was developed first,[44] and is sometimes associated with Later Heaven arrangement of the bagua. This and the Yellow River Chart (Hetu, sometimes associated with the Earlier Heaven bagua) are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao.[45] The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the Yaodian section of the Shangshu or Book of Documents) dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.[46]In Yaodian, the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:[46]The diagrams are also linked with the sifang (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty.[47] The sifang is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in Hongshan culture's astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to Yellow Emperor (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see compass).[48]Traditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.The Form School is the oldest school of feng shui. Qing Wuzi in the Han dynasty describes it in the \"Book of the Tomb\" [1] and Guo Pu of the Jin dynasty follows up with a more complete description in The Book of Burial.The Form School was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs (Yin House feng shui), which was of great importance.[23] The school then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings (Yang House feng shui).The \"form\" in Form School refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the yin-yang concept and the traditional five elements (Wu Xing: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).The Form School analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal qi.[49] It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.The Compass School is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight cardinal directions, each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the Luopan, a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.[50][51][52]The Compass School includes techniques such as Flying Star and Eight Mansions.Aside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.[53]There is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional schools is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple schools in their own practices.[54]More recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional schools, and focus mainly on the use of the bagua.The Eight Life Aspirations style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the Bagua government of the eight aspirations. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.San Yuan Method, 三元派 (Pinyin: sān yuán pài)San He Method, 三合派 (environmental analysis using a compass)OthersTraditional feng shui relies upon the compass to give accurate readings. However, critics point out that the compass degrees are often inaccurate as fluctuations caused by solar winds have the ability to greatly disturb the electromagnetic field of the earth.[citation needed] Determining a property or site location based upon Magnetic North will result in inaccuracies because true magnetic north fluctuates.[71]Matteo Ricci (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of Jesuit China missions, may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas... tells about feng shui masters (geologi, in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites \"with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot\". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the \"recondite science\" of geomancy along with astrology as yet another superstitio absurdissima of the heathens: \"What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?\".[72]Victorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui.[73] In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W. Pitcher railed at the \"rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture,\" and urged fellow missionaries \"to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about fung-shuy\".[74]After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a \"feudalistic superstitious practice\" and a \"social evil\" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times.[75][76] Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the Republic of China (Taiwan), where traditional culture was not suppressed.[77]Persecution was the most severe during the Cultural Revolution, when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called Four Olds to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by Red Guards and their works burned. After the death of Mao Zedong and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's China. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of \"promoting feudalistic superstitions\" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.[78] Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.[79]Partly because of the Cultural Revolution, in today's mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be much lower[80] Learning feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo in today's China.[81][82][83] Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006,[84] and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing. A number of Chinese academics permitted to research on the subject of feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings, such as Cao Dafeng, the Vice-President of Fudan University,[85] and Liu Shenghuan of Tongji University.Westerners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western Boxer Rebellion for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:[86]It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.[87]Still others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different schools of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: \"Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork\".[88][89] Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact[90] Mark Johnson:[91]This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.Nonetheless, after Richard Nixon journeyed to the People's Republic of China in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the United States and has since been reinvented by New Age entrepreneurs for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as Donald Trump which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age \"energy\" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.[92]Others have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting \"lucky bamboo\" in ecosystems that could not handle them.[93]Feng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in Gansu, on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton \"spirit rock\" to the county seat to ward off \"bad luck.\"[94]The stage magician duo Penn and Teller dedicated an episode of their Bullshit! television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of Feng Shui in the Western World as science. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different Feng Shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of Feng Shui.Apart from any mystical implications, Feng Shui may be simply understood as a traditional test of architectural goodness using a collection of metaphors. The test may be static or a simulation. Simulations may involve moving an imaginary person or organic creature, such as a dragon of a certain size and flexibility, through a floor plan to uncover awkward turns and cramped spaces before actual construction. This is entirely analogous to imagining how a wheelchair might pass through a building, and is a plausible exercise for architects, who are expected to have exceptional spatial visualization talents. A static test might try to measure comfort in architecture through a ‘hills and valleys’ metaphor. The big hill at your back is a metaphor for security, the open valley and stream represents air and light, and the circle of low hills in front represents both invitation to visitors and your control of your immediate environment. The various Feng Shui tenets represent a set of metaphors that suggest architectural qualities that the average human finds comfortable.Many Asians, especially people of Chinese descent, believe it[clarification needed] is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of Fu Lu Shou in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial output. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.[95] Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.[96]In recent years,[when?] a new brand of easier-to-implement DIY Feng Shui known as Symbolic Feng Shui, which is popularized by Grandmaster[97] Lillian Too, is being practised by Feng Shui enthusiasts. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) Five Element objects, such as Money God and tortoise, at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative Productive-Cycle environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.Feng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,[98] in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.[citation needed] In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to Hong Kong Disneyland by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, Wing Chao, in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.[99]At Singapore Polytechnic and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and interior designers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or geomancy) consultants eventually.[100]There is a divergence between some feng shui schools on the need or not to adapt the ancient Chinese theories when feng shui is used in the Southern Hemisphere. The differences between the two hemispheres are a fact of reality, but its influence on the feng shui not is unanimity among scholars and practitioners of Chinese technique.The feng shui schools to the Southern Hemisphere defend the need for changes, that span the feng shui and Chinese Astrology 4 Pillars. Among the main arguments for changes to be made can be cited:The validity of these statements can involve discussions and studies. The following article outlines some reasons and methods used by adopting the adjustments to the Southern Hemisphere.The application of feng shui depends on where we are on earth, the place of geography, near a river, where supposedly \"energy flows\", is moving or near a mountain where energy accumulates. In the case of people: where they are born, where they live.Speaking in geographical coordinates, east and west remains, plus the equator acts as a mirror dividing Earth into two hemispheres, north and south.In the Northern Hemisphere cold it is in the north – the Arctic, and the heat in the South the equator. Unlike the Southern Hemisphere where the heat is in the north, the cold is in the south, in Antarctica. The seasons also are reversed. When it is summer in the southern hemisphere, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. When it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, it is spring in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa. The I Ching mentions that we must turn to the light side, to meditate, i.e. sul in the Northern Hemisphere; which corresponds to turn north in the southern hemisphere. This is based on the position of the sun, which in the southern hemisphere rises in the east, it goes to the north and sets in the west. In the translation of the I Ching for the Portuguese it is also emphasized that one should observe the season referred to in the text and not the month in question, since the work was written in China, which fully meets in the northern hemisphere, and the months corresponding to the seasons are always different in the two hemispheres of the Earth. For example, the sign that represents the height of summer is the horse. Corresponds to heat, fire element, December, toward magnetic north, in the southern hemisphere; while the horse in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the month of June and the south.The 5 elements (fire / summer, earth, metal / fall, water / winter, wood / spring) are related to the seasons, with directions, with the 12 signs (animals), with the months, days and hours, yielding a calendar.When working on the floor plan of a building, the technique is used the \"Bahzai\", and in the case of people the technique of \"Min-gua\". The 8 trigrams of the I Ching will be related to magnetic coordinates, respectively, in the Southern Hemisphere, it goes for most of Brazil, including São Paulo: North 9, Northeastern 4, East 3, Southeast 8, south 1, Southwest 6, west 7, northwest _se 2 is a matrix (mathematics) 3x3, which is the plan, 360 degrees + (clockwise Northern Hemisphere) or – (anti-clockwise Southern Hemisphere); 5 is in the center, which is the number considered sacred.\"Magic Square\"The relationship between the 12 signs and the five elements originate to 60 binomials. In Summer 2006 is the year of the Metal Dragon in the Southern Hemisphere. The year of change occurs in the 1st Spring Month because the Lunar Year start on Tiger Month 1st Spring, in Summer 2008 is the year of the Water Horse (binomial 19). In 2009 is the Year of the Water Sheep. This date is calculated as the Northern Hemisphere.","path":[52378,-4.19227219,50.3794212,52199,-4.19240999,50.3793411,51837,-4.19229507,50.3793716,50397,-4.19224215,50.3794212,49052,-4.19238281,50.3793793,48897,-4.19132185,50.3791084,48747,-4.18936205,50.3763695,48568,-4.18779898,50.3726997,48390,-4.18806601,50.3688202,48268,-4.18725204,50.3660698,48088,-4.18262005,50.3638115,47967,-4.17909098,50.3628197,47787,-4.17406797,50.3612289,47577,-4.16932678,50.357811,47398,-4.16534901,50.35532,47219,-4.16187477,50.3524818,47068,-4.15923214,50.3500099,46948,-4.16037703,50.3474083,46828,-4.16338682,50.3453293,46707,-4.16638994,50.3429298,46527,-4.17240191,50.3405685,46348,-4.1798501,50.3390312,46168,-4.18692398,50.3368797,45898,-4.19659901,50.333931,44731,-4.19707012,50.3340607,43330,-4.19709301,50.3340492,42752,-4.19706678,50.3340607,40231,-4.19708681,50.3340683,38612,-4.1970849,50.3340683,37352,-4.1970849,50.3340492,37171,-4.19712496,50.3340683,36991,-4.19714499,50.3340683,36181,-4.19724178,50.3340302,36061,-4.1958499,50.3345108,35850,-4.19229794,50.3326607,35670,-4.18967295,50.3302917,35521,-4.18884706,50.3277588,35340,-4.18667984,50.3254814,35101,-4.183218,50.3240585,34984,-4.18037224,50.3224106,34830,-4.17617798,50.3207016,34651,-4.17198992,50.3189011,34502,-4.16964817,50.3174896,34381,-4.16370487,50.3145103,34261,-4.16166782,50.3136101,34082,-4.15365505,50.3095284,33961,-4.14970016,50.3072701,33841,-4.14595222,50.3049316,33721,-4.1439929,50.30373,33604,-4.1404748,50.3012886,33481,-4.13664722,50.2989197,33361,-4.1307168,50.2956505,33213,-4.12775707,50.2941093,33062,-4.12042904,50.290329,32913,-4.11740017,50.2887802,32762,-4.11156988,50.2856483,32641,-4.10652208,50.2829819,32521,-4.10447216,50.2820206,32341,-4.09889793,50.2789497,32221,-4.09506321,50.2768593,32101,-4.09099293,50.2746811,31981,-4.08678198,50.2725296,31832,-4.0820322,50.2697716,31681,-4.07634497,50.2672882,31502,-4.06742096,50.2628288,31351,-4.06415319,50.261261,31200,-4.05862713,50.2585411,31089,-4.05236006,50.2554817,30962,-4.04853487,50.2533913,30840,-4.04668522,50.2523499,30691,-4.0423522,50.2500496,30542,-4.03808689,50.2477989,30422,-4.03466988,50.2459717,30302,-4.03143215,50.2439003,30121,-4.02502489,50.2402496,30001,-4.02131319,50.2382584,29880,-4.01866007,50.2366486,29762,-4.01513004,50.2346115,29641,-4.01047802,50.2320518,29521,-4.0078249,50.2304306,29403,-4.00532007,50.2285995,29251,-4.00130177,50.2260704,29102,-3.99710488,50.223259,28891,-3.99235296,50.2190399,28741,-3.98845196,50.2159309,28622,-3.98382211,50.2130585,28501,-3.98062491,50.2114487,28380,-3.97671795,50.2089996,28201,-3.97168708,50.205101,28022,-3.96619201,50.2012291,27902,-3.96086693,50.1971703,27781,-3.95911002,50.1957703,27663,-3.95508695,50.1922607,27540,-3.95291209,50.1900902,27422,-3.94973707,50.1872406,27303,-3.94628501,50.1844406,27183,-3.9413681,50.1810989,27062,-3.93533206,50.1785812,26941,-3.93295503,50.1773911,26821,-3.92835498,50.1750908,26672,-3.9215951,50.1733589,26522,-3.91108704,50.1725388,26312,-3.90358996,50.1722984,26162,-3.8961401,50.171669,25951,-3.88566303,50.17099,25801,-3.87815309,50.1708488,25621,-3.8689301,50.1701012,25503,-3.86291504,50.1693611,25292,-3.85272694,50.1676407,25141,-3.84529495,50.1665611,24991,-3.83777809,50.1657104,24843,-3.83044791,50.1648712,24631,-3.81989002,50.1635704,24484,-3.81252003,50.162571,24331,-3.80490994,50.1617393,24183,-3.79755712,50.1609802,24060,-3.79147506,50.1603699,23882,-3.78268504,50.1595993,23702,-3.77375197,50.1585884,23581,-3.7677319,50.1580811,23461,-3.7617631,50.1575317,23281,-3.75299811,50.1567001,23163,-3.74735999,50.1561203,23044,-3.7418251,50.1554909,22861,-3.73324704,50.1547318,22620,-3.72216797,50.1531181,22501,-3.71690011,50.1519699,22291,-3.70833993,50.1492805,22141,-3.70231199,50.1474686,21992,-3.69637799,50.1456909,21841,-3.6905179,50.1438293,21663,-3.68344498,50.1417618,21513,-3.67716193,50.1403809,21333,-3.66942191,50.1389084,21181,-3.66283488,50.1377411,20974,-3.65383196,50.1360207,20766,-3.6450901,50.1341095,20641,-3.63960505,50.1332092,20521,-3.63435507,50.1325302,20373,-3.62787509,50.1316795,20221,-3.6209631,50.1308517,20070,-3.61418295,50.1299515,19922,-3.60761809,50.1289101,19741,-3.59957504,50.1276588,19591,-3.59288692,50.1268311,19445,-3.58628702,50.1263084,19322,-3.58064795,50.1262589,19141,-3.57225204,50.125721,18990,-3.56534195,50.1251411,18841,-3.55855489,50.1245308,18692,-3.55193496,50.1235695,18542,-3.54537511,50.1222115,18421,-3.54003191,50.1212006,18213,-3.53179312,50.1200981,18062,-3.52682805,50.1206207,17943,-3.52268791,50.1210098,17793,-3.51761007,50.1214104,17641,-3.51269507,50.1218796,17490,-3.50793195,50.1222,17282,-3.50063992,50.122139,17101,-3.49462199,50.1221809,16895,-3.48793793,50.1221809,16717,-3.48163009,50.1218681,16531,-3.47514701,50.1214294,16381,-3.46993709,50.1209908,16172,-3.46261811,50.1202316,16023,-3.45756507,50.1196404,15872,-3.45255494,50.1190491,15690,-3.44624805,50.1178398,15542,-3.44131207,50.1170502,15335,-3.43420196,50.115921,15153,-3.42767191,50.114769,15004,-3.42246294,50.1138687,14851

STAR","text":"NIGHT STAR:Night (Star Trek: Voyager.\"Night\" is the 95th episode of the American syndicated science fiction television series Star Trek: Voyager,[1] the first episode of the fifth season.\n\nIn this episode, as Voyager crosses an enormous expanse with absolutely no stars visible in any direction, they encounter local denizens whose home is being used as a dumping ground for toxic waste by the Malon.\n\nPlot[edit]\nEn route towards the Alpha Quadrant, the Federation starship Voyager is forced to travel through a sector of space, \"The Void\", where starlight is completely shrouded, creating a dense black cloud. The journey through this sector will take two years, but only two months into the travel has set the crew on edge. Left with nothing to do in the empty darkness, Captain Janeway has taken the time to reflect on their situation, feeling intense guilt for her choices that left the crew stranded in the Delta Quadrant.\n\nOne day, all power to the ship is knocked out, caused by an external field. They discover several alien intruders aboard Voyager and are able to capture one. They manage to restore power, discovering themselves surrounded by three smaller ships, but soon these are chased away by a larger ship of different design. Its pilot introduces himself to the Voyager crew as Emck, a Malon. After learning of Voyager's plight, he offers to lead the ship to a vortex that can lead them to the other side of The Void, in exchange for the alien prisoner. Janeway refuses until she learns more.\n\nThe alien in Sickbay is healed, and apologizes for his species' actions. They are a people that are trying to fight the Malon, as the Malon dump toxic theta radiation into the vortex, harming their species. Janeway attempts to arrange a deal with Emck, to provide him with Federation technology to recycle the theta radiation into useful energy and matter in exchange for passage to the vortex, but Emck refuses, as this technology would ruin his livelihood as a waste hauler.\n\nJaneway comes to learn of the vortex' location from the night alien. She attempts to order the crew to send Voyager through the vortex while she stays behind in a shuttlecraft to destroy it, ending the Malon's use of The Void as a dumping ground. The crew refuses, acknowledging that they do not blame Janeway or harbor resentment for her actions that stranded them in the Delta Quadrant. Together, they come up with a second plan, to launch torpedoes shortly after entering the vortex, riding out the shockwave as the vortex is destroyed. As Voyager approaches the vortex, they are attacked by the Malon, but soon the smaller alien ships reappear and distract the Malon long enough for the ship to enter and destroy the vortex. The journey leaves them but a short distance from the edge of The Void and within minutes, the Voyager crew is elated to see stars once again.","path":[46527,-4.11085987,50.3046608,46347,-4.11788797,50.3082504,46226,-4.12219,50.3111115,46046,-4.12843323,50.3157692,45839,-4.13140488,50.321991,45657,-4.1335578,50.3273506,45477,-4.13554096,50.33255,45296,-4.13743782,50.3378906,45148,-4.13763523,50.341629,44967,-4.13719797,50.3462181,44817,-4.13705206,50.3503304,44637,-4.13711596,50.3549385,44398,-4.1366868,50.3587685,44217,-4.13231516,50.3621407,44068,-4.12750721,50.3628502,43861,-4.12081003,50.36063,39789,-4.12360477,50.3582497,38470,-4.12362289,50.3582497,38349,-4.12345791,50.3587303,38169,-4.1199398,50.359539,38021,-4.12210178,50.3602715,37871,-4.12773705,50.3617897,37719,-4.13389015,50.3612289,37540,-4.13680601,50.35709,37359,-4.13640404,50.3520889,37119,-4.13512278,50.3453598,36938,-4.13416719,50.340229,36759,-4.13295317,50.3351517,36611,-4.13226509,50.3310585,36460,-4.131042,50.326931,36310,-4.12940216,50.3229485,36129,-4.1278429,50.318161,35980,-4.12555218,50.3142509,35800,-4.12179518,50.3100815,35650,-4.11778784,50.3068695,35501,-4.11300516,50.3039284,35318,-4.106493,50.3034706,34441,-4.07281208,50.3099289,34322,-4.06810999,50.3099403,34201,-4.0643301,50.3116989,34082,-4.06120014,50.3122406,33961,-4.05721521,50.3107491,33841,-4.05234003,50.3116798]},{"name":"MOONSTONE","text":"MOONSTONE:Moonstone may refer to:Moonstone (gemstone)Moonstone is a sodium potassium aluminium silicate, with the chemical formula (Na,K)AlSi3O8.Etymology[edit]\nIts name is derived from a visual effect, or sheen, caused by light diffraction within a micro-structure consisting of a regular succession of feldspar layers.\n\nHistory[edit]\nMoonstone has been used in jewelry for millenia, including ancient civilizations. The Romans admired moonstone, as they believed it was born from solidified rays of the moon.[1] Both the Romans and Greeks associated Moonstone with their lunar deities. In more recent history, the moonstone became popular during the Art Nouveau period; French goldsmith René Lalique and many others created a large quantity of jewelry using this stone.[2]Geology[edit]\nThe most common moonstone is of the mineral adularia, named for an early mining site near Mt. Adular in Switzerland, now the town of St. Gotthard.[3] The plagioclase feldspar oligoclase also produces moonstone specimens. Moonstone is feldspar with a pearly and opalescent schiller.[3][4] An alternative name is hecatolite.[4]\n\nFormation[edit]Moonstone is composed of two feldspar species, orthoclase and albite. The two species are intermingled. Then, as the newly formed mineral cools, the intergrowth of orthoclase and albite separates into stacked, alternating layers. When light falls between these thin, flat layers, it scatters in many directions producing the phenomenon called adularescence. Occurrence[edit] Deposits of moonstone occur in Armenia (mainly from Lake Sevan), Australia, the Austrian Alps, Mexico, Madagascar, Myanmar, Norway, Poland, India, Sri Lanka[5] and the United States.[4]\nIn popular culture[edit]\nThe moonstone is the Florida State Gemstone; it was designated as such in 1970 to commemorate the Moon landings, which took off from Kennedy Space Center. Despite it being the Florida State Gemstone, it does not naturally occur in the state.[6]","path":[47876,-4.13361979,50.3670006,47696,-4.1327281,50.3654518,47486,-4.13318014,50.3618889,47336,-4.13612509,50.3599014,47157,-4.1381278,50.3570595,46977,-4.13969517,50.3540306,46797,-4.13806009,50.3515015,46647,-4.13906813,50.3483887,46437,-4.14236403,50.3451691,46286,-4.14696789,50.3437614,46136,-4.15079021,50.342289,45957,-4.15569019,50.3409004,45806,-4.15925217,50.3403282,45597,-4.16437483,50.3390312,45446,-4.1682148,50.3377304,45296,-4.17241096,50.3370285,45117,-4.17652798,50.335289,44967,-4.17990208,50.3340988,44846,-4.18282318,50.3331718,44666,-4.18758297,50.3317299,44516,-4.19056177,50.3306618,44317,-4.19353819,50.3292885,44137,-4.1949501,50.3283806,43957,-4.19515514,50.3284187,42517,-4.19507599,50.3282013,41227,-4.19485903,50.3282318,41076,-4.19474983,50.3286285,40926,-4.19356203,50.3304482,40806,-4.1917882,50.3310089,40537,-4.18835497,50.3320808,40177,-4.18420792,50.3331299,39997,-4.18083,50.3341789,39846,-4.17928505,50.3345108,39731,-4.17856312,50.3351288,39564,-4.1772151,50.3356705,39384,-4.17584991,50.3363419,39204,-4.17430496,50.3369789,39024,-4.17280293,50.3375893,38663,-4.16999483,50.3385201,38483,-4.16848278,50.339119,38303,-4.16718817,50.33955,38034,-4.16553402,50.3400307,37867,-4.16403294,50.3405914,37686,-4.16321707,50.3408318,37506,-4.16232681,50.3409996,37326,-4.16169596,50.3410416,36997,-4.16235399,50.3407288,36756,-4.15904903,50.342289,36607,-4.1567831,50.3432083,36487,-4.15492678,50.3439598,36337,-4.15265179,50.345089,36097,-4.15159988,50.3479996,35946,-4.15123177,50.3497696,35827,-4.15110683,50.3502998,35706,-4.14864779,50.3499107,35556,-4.14504814,50.3493004,35317,-4.14350224,50.3482094,35166,-4.14113188,50.3478889,34897,-4.13765287,50.3470612,34746,-4.13463211,50.3469086,34626,-4.13311815,50.3467598,34506,-4.1340332,50.3476181,34237,-4.1381321,50.3505516,33997,-4.14096022,50.3526192,33756,-4.14276981,50.3550415,33541,-4.1400671,50.357811,33422,-4.13766813,50.3594208,33301,-4.1352849,50.3604202,33181,-4.13383484,50.3620911,33066,-4.13310003,50.3629684,32916,-4.13273716,50.3653717,32331,-4.1327672,50.3672791,29943,-4.13373899,50.36689,28389,-4.13376284,50.3669395]},{"name":"HENRIETTA POLYDORE","text":"HENRIETTA POLYDORE:The page \"HENRIETTA POLYDORE\" does not exist.

They are said to live underground in fairy mounds, across the western sea, or in an invisible world that coexists with the world of humans. This world is described in the Lebor Gabála Érenn as a parallel universe in which the aos sí walk amongst the living. In the Irish language, aos sí means \"people of the mounds\" (the mounds are known in Irish as \"the sídhe\"). In Irish literature the people of the mounds are also called daoine sídhe [ˈdiːnʲə ˈʃiːə]; in Scottish mythology they are daoine sìth. They are variously said to be the ancestors, the spirits of nature, or goddesses and gods.[1]Some secondary and tertiary sources, including well-known and influential authors such as W. B. Yeats, refer to aos sí simply as \"the sídhe\" (lit. \"mounds\").[2]In many Gaelic tales, the aos sí are later, literary versions of the Tuatha Dé Danann (\"People of the Goddess Danu\")—the deities and deified ancestors of Irish mythology. Some sources describe them as the survivors of the Tuatha Dé Danann who retreated into the Otherworld after they were defeated by the Milesians—the mortal Sons of Míl Espáine who, like many other early invaders of Ireland, came from Iberia. Geoffrey Keating, an Irish historian of the late 17th century, equates Iberia with the Land of the Dead.In folk belief and practice, the aos sí are often appeased with offerings, and care is taken to avoid angering or insulting them. Often they are not named directly, but rather spoken of as \"The Good Neighbors\", \"The Fair Folk\", or simply \"The Folk\". The most common names for them, aos sí, aes sídhe, daoine sídhe (singular duine sídhe) and daoine sìth mean, literally, \"people of the mounds\" (referring to the sidhe). The aos sí are generally described as stunningly beautiful, though they can also be terrible and hideous.Aos sí are sometimes seen as fierce guardians of their abodes—whether a fairy hill, a fairy ring, a special tree (often a hawthorn) or a particular loch or wood. The Gaelic Otherworld is seen as closer at the times of dusk and dawn, therefore this is a special time to the aos sí, as are some festivals such as Samhain, Beltane and Midsummer.The sídhe are the hills or tumuli that dot the Irish landscape. In modern Irish the word is sí; in Scottish Gaelic, sìth; in Old Irish síde and the singular is síd.[3] In a number of later, English-language texts, the word sídhe is incorrectly used both for the mounds and the people of the mounds. However sidh in older texts refers specifically to \"the palaces, courts, halls or residences\" of the ghostly beings that, according to Gaedhelic mythology, inhabit them.[4]As part of the terms of their surrender to the Milesians, the Tuatha Dé Danann agreed to retreat and dwell underground. In some later poetry, each tribe of the Tuatha Dé Danann was given its own mound.The fact that many of these sídhe have been found to be ancient burial mounds has contributed to the theory that the aos sí were the pre-Celtic occupants of Ireland. \"The Book of Invasions\", \"The Annals of the Four Masters\", and oral history support this view.Others present these stories as mythology deriving from Greek cultural influence, deriving arguments mainly from Hesiod's Works and Days, which portrays the basic moral foundation and plantation techniques of the citizens of Greece and describes the races of men, created by the Greek deities. However, these views have been deemed unlikely, and the so-called influence can be reasonably explained by the similar moral foundations stemming from the two cultures' Indo-European background.The story of the Aes Sídhe is found all over Scotland and Ireland, many tales referring to how the Norse invaders drove Scottish inhabitants underground to live in the hills. This part of the legend contributes to the changeling myth in west European folklore.The banshee or bean sídhe (from Old Irish: ban síde), which means \"woman of the síd,[5] has come to indicate any supernatural woman of Ireland who announces a coming death by wailing and keening. Her counterpart in Scottish mythology is the bean sìth (sometimes spelled bean-sìdh). Other varieties of aos sí and daoine sìth include the Scottish bean nighe: the washerwoman who is seen washing the bloody clothing or armour of the person who is doomed to die; the leanan sídhe: the \"fairy lover\"; the cat sìth: a fairy cat; and the Cù Sìth: fairy dog.The sluagh sídhe—\"the fairy host\"—is sometimes depicted in Irish and Scottish lore as a crowd of airborne spirits, perhaps the cursed, evil or restless dead. The siabhra (anglicised as \"sheevra\"), may be a type of these lesser spirits, prone to evil and mischief.[6][7] However an Ulster folk song also uses \"sheevra\" simply to mean \"spirit\" or \"fairy\".[8]Creideamh Sí is Irish for the \"Fairy Faith\", a collection of beliefs and practices observed by those who wish to keep good relationships with the aos sí and avoid angering them.[1] The custom of offering milk and traditional foods—such as baked goods, apples or berries—to the aos sí have survived through the Christian era into the present day in parts of Ireland, Scotland and the diaspora.[1] Those who maintain some degree of belief in the aos sí also are aware to leave their sacred places alone and protect them from damage through road or housing construction.[1][9]","path":[46727,-4.11161709,50.3637619,46517,-4.1115818,50.3636208,46397,-4.11099815,50.3636093,46248,-4.11502218,50.3610497,46067,-4.12184095,50.3610306,45859,-4.12925482,50.3622704,45708,-4.13434315,50.3606606,45557,-4.13582277,50.3575897,45379,-4.13445997,50.3538399,45227,-4.132617,50.3543205,45077,-4.13173723,50.3515587,44957,-4.13134098,50.3492508,44837,-4.13168097,50.3468819,44659,-4.13266706,50.3434906,44537,-4.133214,50.3414612,44420,-4.13375187,50.3395996,44297,-4.13446188,50.3375893,44179,-4.13526678,50.3355713,44057,-4.13617992,50.3337593,43907,-4.13758993,50.3313293,43728,-4.14209509,50.3294907,43579,-4.14572716,50.3281097,43458,-4.14847994,50.3270302,43307,-4.15240097,50.32547,43157,-4.15625811,50.3239098,43008,-4.16022301,50.3222694,42857,-4.16439295,50.3206291,42677,-4.16973782,50.3185501,42498,-4.1747632,50.3166199,42348,-4.17909479,50.3148918,42167,-4.18433523,50.3129501,42017,-4.18918705,50.3117294,41897,-4.19355297,50.3110504,41717,-4.20001507,50.3099899,41567,-4.20642281,50.3096809,39047,-4.31073189,50.3074989,38898,-4.31785679,50.3081894,38777,-4.32365704,50.3087082,38598,-4.3323102,50.3094482,38387,-4.34253597,50.3103104,38238,-4.34950781,50.3108101,38027,-4.35967684,50.3115005,37188,-4.3961401,50.3122597,34441,-4.50797176,50.3143806,34261,-4.51513815,50.3145485,34141,-4.51972723,50.3146896,34021,-4.52432203,50.3147888,33902,-4.52788496,50.3149109,33722,-4.53607988,50.3151093,33541,-4.54256201,50.3152618,33422,-4.54677486,50.3153687,33241,-4.55293322,50.3154907,33123,-4.55697012,50.3155518,33001,-4.56091404,50.315609,32881,-4.56548214,50.3158684,32762,-4.56964493,50.3162384,32641,-4.57390213,50.3166008,32462,-4.58039713,50.3170395,32342,-4.58465004,50.3172302,32222,-4.58861017,50.317421,32101,-4.59256983,50.3175087,31982,-4.59637403,50.3175812,31862,-4.60024786,50.3176193,31742,-4.60426998,50.3176613,31621,-4.60857677,50.3177185,31442,-4.61435509,50.3184814,31322,-4.617167,50.3190002,31202,-4.619946,50.3195305,31089,-4.62271023,50.3200989,30962,-4.62552404,50.3206711,30842,-4.628263,50.3212204,30694,-4.63246679,50.3220711,30542,-4.63558817,50.3226891,30362,-4.64002323,50.3247986]},{"name":"CALYPSO","text":"CALYPSO:Calypso may refer to: Calypso (mythology), nymph who was the lover of Odysseus in Greek mythology. Calypso (/kəˈlɪpsoʊ/; Greek: Καλυψώ, Kalypsō) was a nymph in Greek mythology, who lived on the island of Ogygia, where she detained Odysseus for seven years.Genealogy[edit]\nCalypso is generally said to be the daughter of the Titan Atlas[1] and Pleione.[2]\n\nHesiod, and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, mention either a different Calypso or possibly the same Calypso as one of the Oceanid daughters of Tethys and Oceanus.[3] Apollodorus includes the name Calypso in his list of Nereids, the daughters of Nereus and Doris.Name[edit]\nThe etymology of Calypso's name is from καλύπτω (kalyptō), meaning \"to cover\", \"to conceal\", \"to hide\", or \"to deceive\".[5] According to Etymologicum Magnum her name means καλύπτουσα το διανοούμενον (kalýptousa to dianooúmenon), i.e. \"concealing the knowledge\", which combined with the Homeric epithet δολόεσσα (dolóessa), meaning subtle or wily, justifies the hermetic character of Calypso and her island. καλύπτω is derived from Proto-Indo-European *ḱel-, making it cognate with the English word Hell.\n\nMythology[edit]\nCalypso is remembered the most for her role in Homer's Odyssey, in which she attempts to keep the fabled Greek hero Odysseus on her island to make him her immortal husband. According to Homer, Calypso kept Odysseus prisoner at Ogygia for seven years,[6] while Apollodorus says five years[7] and Hyginus says one.[8] Calypso enchants Odysseus with her singing as she moves to and from, weaving on her loom with a golden shuttle. During this time they have sex together, although Odysseus soon comes to wish for circumstances to change.\n\nOdysseus can no longer bear being separated from his wife Penelope and wants to go to Calypso to tell her. His patron goddess Athena asks Zeus to order the release of Odysseus from the island, and Zeus orders the messenger Hermes to tell Calypso to set Odysseus free, for it was not his destiny to live with her forever. She angrily comments on how the gods hate goddesses having affairs with mortals, but eventually concedes, sending Odysseus on his way after providing him with wine, bread, and the materials for a raft.\n\nHomer does not mention any children by Calypso. By some accounts, which come after the Odyssey, Calypso bore Odysseus a son, Latinus,[9] though Circe is usually given as Latinus' mother.[10] In other accounts Calypso bore Odysseus two children, Nausithous and Nausinous.[11] The story of Odysseus and Calypso has some close resemblances to the interactions between Gilgamesh and Siduri in the Epic of Gilgamesh in that \"the lone female plies the inconsolable hero-wanderer with drink and sends him off to a place beyond the sea reserved for a special class of honoured people\" and \"to prepare for the voyage he has to cut down and trim timbers.\"[12]\n\nCalypso music, a genre of Trinidadian folk music. Calypso is a style of Afro-Caribbean music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago during the early to mid-20th century and spread to the rest of Caribbean Antilles and Venezuela. Its rhythms can be traced back to West African Kaiso and the arrival of French planters and their slaves from the French Antilles in the 18th century.\n\nCalypso drew upon African and French influences, and became the voice of the people[citation needed]. It was characterized by highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals, which was most often sung in a French creole and led by a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a chantuelle and eventually, calypsonian. As English replaced \"patois\" (Antillean creole) as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the government. It allowed the masses to challenge the doings of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of Port of Spain and San Fernando. Calypso continued to play an important role in political expression, and also served to document the history of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nCalypso in the Caribbean includes a range of genres, including: the Benna genre of Antiguan and Barbudan music; Mento, a style of Jamaican folk music that greatly influenced ska and reggae; Ska, the precursor to rocksteady and reggae; Spouge, a style of Barbadian popular music; Dominica Cadence-lypso, which mixed calypso with the cadence of Haiti; and soca music, a style of Kaiso/calypso, with influences from cadence-lypso, soul, and funk.\nCalypso (comics), Marvel Comics character. Calypso Ezili is a fictional character, a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.","path":[59264,-3.58755994,50.26717,59116,-3.58923006,50.2639198,58994,-3.59079695,50.2610207,58844,-3.59260988,50.2574005,58694,-3.59452701,50.2537193,58574,-3.59591293,50.2505913,58457,-3.59758806,50.2477989,58274,-3.60007691,50.243351,58156,-3.60220194,50.2408485,57977,-3.60549212,50.2369614,57794,-3.60995507,50.2319717,57614,-3.61454701,50.2271194,57436,-3.61851692,50.2232018,57284,-3.62196493,50.2199707,57134,-3.62551689,50.2167511,57016,-3.62899995,50.214489,56834,-3.63488698,50.2112617,56655,-3.64130712,50.208519,56534,-3.64619493,50.2071686,56355,-3.65337205,50.2051697,56235,-3.65813494,50.2038193,56087,-3.66409492,50.2021217,55904,-3.67151308,50.2000694,55724,-3.6790421,50.1984787,55575,-3.68533993,50.1973991,55454,-3.69047809,50.1965485,55276,-3.69795799,50.1953697,55065,-3.7070179,50.1942215,54884,-3.71461701,50.1933289,54708,-3.72185707,50.1925011,54554,-3.72826195,50.1920509,54374,-3.73570991,50.1919518,54194,-3.74311304,50.1919785,54074,-3.74802995,50.1919289,53894,-3.75544,50.1918411,53686,-3.76391506,50.1916389,53504,-3.76977801,50.1916809,53354,-3.77472711,50.1918297,53234,-3.77878499,50.1919899,53024,-3.78547001,50.1923904,52875,-3.79036689,50.1926689,52754,-3.79464293,50.1929016,52605,-3.8003881,50.1935196,52455,-3.80613303,50.1941299,52335,-3.81093502,50.1946182,52155,-3.81830692,50.1952591,52034,-3.82310796,50.1957092,51824,-3.83182311,50.1963081,51674,-3.83864498,50.1972389,51554,-3.84376502,50.1991997,51374,-3.85169792,50.2019501,51195,-3.85932207,50.20467,51045,-3.86594009,50.2066193,50895,-3.87249708,50.2086983,50746,-3.87943697,50.2106705,50595,-3.88605309,50.2132683,50415,-3.89375305,50.2161903,50234,-3.90175796,50.2191696,50084,-3.90838289,50.2216911,49906,-3.91633296,50.2245903,49754,-3.9227829,50.2271385,49604,-3.92915297,50.2297096,49424,-3.93628001,50.2328796,49274,-3.94207692,50.2355614,49095,-3.94900489,50.2386093,48946,-3.95492291,50.2411118,48764,-3.96264291,50.2439384,48615,-3.9691031,50.2461205,48464,-3.97551203,50.2483101,48317,-3.98158002,50.2503395,48135,-3.98888803,50.2528381,48014,-3.99384809,50.2544785,47805,-4.00254488,50.2573204,47624,-4.01047707,50.2599182,47475,-4.01687288,50.2622299,47354,-4.02177715,50.2642288,47207,-4.02795219,50.2665405,47054,-4.03451681,50.2687988,46875,-4.04220819,50.2715111,46664,-4.05116987,50.2748184,46455,-4.05971813,50.2781181,46304,-4.06573296,50.2804794,46094,-4.07378721,50.2835884,45915,-4.08063221,50.2861786,45675,-4.08988714,50.289669,45555,-4.09426785,50.2911911,45346,-4.10213518,50.2938995,45164,-4.10918713,50.2964096,44985,-4.11606598,50.2994385,44835,-4.12085009,50.3027191,44654,-4.12676096,50.3067513,44475,-4.13279486,50.3107796,44324,-4.13752699,50.313961,44174,-4.14206791,50.3171196,44054,-4.14513206,50.3195305,43875,-4.14906502,50.3231201,43724,-4.15224314,50.3260384,43576,-4.15547514,50.3288612,43425,-4.15903902,50.331749,43246,-4.16139984,50.3348999,43064,-4.16015291,50.338131,42856,-4.15879679,50.3418198,42645,-4.15815401,50.3462105]},{"name":"POLISSON","text":"POLISSON:The Good Old Naughty Days (French title: Polissons et galipettes – \"Rascals and somersaults\"), released in 2002, is a compilation from over 300 recently discovered[1] film clips from silent hardcore pornographic films made between 1905 and 1930,[2] re-edited by director Michel Reilhac, with a new soundtrack by Eric Le Guen.

It is a red brick building constructed in the 1870s.For many years it was the only public building in the hamlet. It remained in use as school for over a half a century. Since then it has been converted into a residence. In 1987 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The school is at the western edge of a one-acre (4,400 m²) lot at the top of a rise on the northeastern edge of the older section of the city of New Hamburg. It has a view south toward the Wappinger Creek estuary at the Hudson River. The land to the west and north is wooded. Some of the original property has since been subdivided and developed with more modern houses.The building itself is a two-story brick structure on a stone foundation with a gabled roof. Asphalt shingles cover the original tin. Its line is marked by broad projecting eaves with a bracketed cornice on all sides. The slightly arched windows have projecting hoods and sills of cast iron. A round vent is in the gable peak on the south (front) elevation, and a fire escape runs across the front.On the east and west are two projecting entrance pavilions. They are similar to the main block in decoration but have flat roofs. The west one, which originally rose to a bell tower on the third story, has a transomed entrance with a decorative hood stopped with corbels.The interior plan is intact. A second floor gym/auditorium space has not been further partitioned, and a large classroom on the first floor still has cast-iron columns in the center and one of its original blackboards.[1\nThe building was probably begun in the early 1870s, during New Hamburg's peak years as a river port. It replaced an old one-room schoolhouse on the main road towards Poughkeepsie, and is first shown on an 1876 map. At the time of its construction it was the only Free School in the Town of Poughkeepsie, with its own local school board.It is still in basic form a one-room schoolhouse, but five times large than the extant Grammar School in Chelsea to the south. Its size and placement on the rise overlooking the river suggest the pride the community of New Hamburg took in it. The modest decoration shows the widespread acceptance of the Picturesque aesthetic in the area at the time.It remained in use until the district was absorbed into the Wappinger Central School District in 1940. After the war it was used as a plastic factory for a while. It lay vacant and was later restored into a house, with art studio space.","path":[79848,-2.086905,50.5057297,79672,-2.09369206,50.5020218,79517,-2.099545,50.4994202,79309,-2.1074481,50.4956093,79127,-2.11427498,50.4923096,78977,-2.11994004,50.4899712,78857,-2.12434196,50.4878693,78737,-2.12859988,50.4855309,78529,-2.13590789,50.4819908,78348,-2.14242792,50.4786606,78197,-2.1478529,50.4759789,78048,-2.15298796,50.4734116,77898,-2.15822697,50.4706383,77778,-2.16254997,50.4690094,77598,-2.16880703,50.4658203,77390,-2.17708993,50.4623108,77239,-2.18353009,50.4604416,77088,-2.19057012,50.4588585,76909,-2.19957495,50.4568291,76760,-2.20640993,50.4550095,76609,-2.2132051,50.4531898,76429,-2.22137809,50.450489,76282,-2.22835994,50.4480896,76161,-2.23393989,50.4461708,76009,-2.24068999,50.4442902,75860,-2.24688005,50.4425087,75682,-2.25398707,50.4403801,75560,-2.2593081,50.4389191,75382,-2.26750493,50.4366302,75260,-2.27291489,50.435051,75111,-2.27967501,50.4330597,74960,-2.28664494,50.43153,74752,-2.296175,50.4299088,74601,-2.30311799,50.4284706,74392,-2.31270003,50.4266396,74212,-2.321105,50.4251289,74061,-2.32841492,50.4236107,73911,-2.33521509,50.4221687,73762,-2.34237003,50.4205017,73612,-2.34910989,50.419281,73432,-2.3576901,50.4176483,73282,-2.36451507,50.4163895,73103,-2.37286305,50.4152107,72985,-2.37857795,50.4148293,72866,-2.38467693,50.4144516,72743,-2.3905499,50.413929,72563,-2.39951706,50.4132996,72413,-2.40657306,50.4127197,72263,-2.4137969,50.4122696,72114,-2.42084789,50.4116096,71934,-2.42902803,50.4109993,71784,-2.43562007,50.4100189,71663,-2.44069695,50.4095688,71544,-2.44596004,50.4090385,71334,-2.45607209,50.4083214,71162,-2.46377802,50.4072685,71064,-2.46850705,50.4062881,70861,-2.47846508,50.4049492,70734,-2.48443007,50.4039192,70585,-2.4911201,50.4027481,70434,-2.49854207,50.4012718,70254,-2.50759006,50.3998795,70075,-2.51744294,50.3987617,69925,-2.52592206,50.3975601,69715,-2.53754807,50.3955307,69536,-2.54759192,50.3941383,69357,-2.55710697,50.3926582,69206,-2.56551504,50.3914909,69086,-2.57204795,50.3901711,68936,-2.58089495,50.3889618,68726,-2.59278202,50.3871002,68577,-2.60158992,50.3859291,68429,-2.61051512,50.384491,68217,-2.62325191,50.383091,68067,-2.63212299,50.3818588,67920,-2.64112711,50.3807487,67737,-2.65198302,50.3791199,67529,-2.664217,50.3770218,67378,-2.67400789,50.3754387,67199,-2.68533492,50.3741112,67018,-2.69663,50.3719482,66838,-2.70788503,50.3700294,66687,-2.7175529,50.3681793,66568,-2.72536206,50.3667793,66358,-2.73854494,50.3645096,66178,-2.74984694,50.3623581,65970,-2.76268005,50.3597412,65789,-2.77391005,50.3573799,65611,-2.7847929,50.3551102,65370,-2.79979491,50.352581,65249,-2.80728507,50.3512993,65009,-2.822685,50.3490982,64860,-2.83206511,50.3470192,64711,-2.84204292,50.34515,64080,-2.88092303,50.3355293,63841,-2.89639807,50.3335419,63510,-2.91796207,50.3304787,62820,-2.96195292,50.3235703,62611,-2.97545695,50.3215485,62463,-2.9853549,50.3203888,62341,-2.99324489,50.3193092,62223,-3.00131702,50.318161,62101,-3.00863695,50.3166809,61982,-3.01637197,50.3164291,61832,-3.02650189,50.3164902,61593,-3.04113293,50.3151016,61353,-3.0559299,50.3129883,61113,-3.07161689,50.3107185,60936,-3.08272791,50.3083687,60753,-3.09412193,50.3060112,60574,-3.104877,50.3034897,60423,-3.11424804,50.3014717,60303,-3.12170792,50.3001518,60184,-3.1288929,50.2988091,59971,-3.14070201,50.2964783,59824,-3.14934206,50.2947884,59644,-3.15971708,50.2925987,59435,-3.17186189,50.2899704,59195,-3.1860621,50.2872581,59015,-3.19671988,50.2854996,58834,-3.20742297,50.2838898,58656,-3.21799707,50.282341,58475,-3.22837806,50.2808495,58325,-3.236835,50.2797508,58175,-3.24547291,50.2785187,57965,-3.25762796,50.2769318,57786,-3.26812506,50.2757683,57606,-3.27812195,50.2743683,57426,-3.28885007,50.2736702,57278,-3.29752493,50.2726707,57277,-3.29752493,50.2726707,57126,-3.30633998,50.2713585,56947,-3.31686306,50.2696304,56797,-3.32618308,50.2686806,56588,-3.33937001,50.2671585,56438,-3.349015,50.2660408,56287,-3.35817504,50.2646217,56109,-3.36935997,50.2630501,55988,-3.37689805,50.2621117,55867,-3.38410997,50.2609291,55749,-3.39121008,50.2598305,55568,-3.40154791,50.2581406,55387,-3.41195011,50.2563896,55268,-3.4189229,50.254921,55089,-3.42901993,50.2524681,54969,-3.43615198,50.2505684,54820,-3.44514799,50.2485085,54638,-3.45566201,50.2462006,54458,-3.46553707,50.243721,54309,-3.47396803,50.2420311,54160,-3.48216,50.24046,53979,-3.491565,50.23802,53800,-3.501815,50.23611,53651,-3.510397,50.2346,53471,-3.521115,50.2326,53320,-3.530057,50.23098,53169,-3.539263,50.2295,53020,-3.548092,50.22795,52871,-3.556367,50.22614,52661,-3.568168,50.22339,52481,-3.578,50.22109,52302,-3.587827,50.21876,52120,-3.598153,50.21641,51972,-3.605963,50.21458,51763,-3.617235,50.2119,51580,-3.627407,50.21007,51433,-3.635327,50.20865,51312,-3.642082,50.20749,51161,-3.649995,50.20589,50951,-3.660422,50.20352,50742,-3.670703,50.20106,50563,-3.678943,50.19891,50412,-3.6863,50.19713,49453,-3.737788,50.18913,49334,-3.744502,50.18914,49126,-3.756677,50.18939,48947,-3.767677,50.18965,48195,-3.810828,50.1

Augustine says that dea Levana is invoked when the child is lifted de terra, from the earth or ground.[2] Her function may be paralleled by the Greek Artemis Orthia, if interpreted as the Artemis who lifts or raises children.[3]It is sometimes supposed that Levana was invoked in a ceremony by which the father lifted the child to acknowledge it as his own, but the existence of such a ceremony is based on tenuous evidence and contradicted by Roman law pertaining to legitimacy of birth.[4] More likely, Levana was the goddess who oversaw the lifting of the child by the midwife immediately after birth. Kneeling or squatting was a more common position for childbirth in antiquity,[5] and the newborn probably came to rest on the ground before the umbilical cord was cut.[6]Thomas de Quincey's prose poem Levana and Our Ladies of Sorrow begins with a discussion of the role of Levana in Roman religion.Levana is the name of an infant and child safety product manufacturer. The brand was established in 2007 and concentrates on electrical means of protection.[7]In the Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer, Levana is the name of the current queen of Luna (a human colony on the moon).","path":[79905,-2.12190008,50.2205582,79764,-2.13355708,50.2198906,79634,-2.14429998,50.2192917,79504,-2.15501308,50.2186584,79384,-2.16490793,50.2181015,79235,-2.17725992,50.2174301,79094,-2.18864703,50.2167892,78874,-2.20658803,50.2158089,78735,-2.217942,50.2151718,78615,-2.22771001,50.2147102,78495,-2.23751712,50.2142982,78365,-2.24813199,50.213871,78245,-2.25789809,50.2134819,78125,-2.26765704,50.2131386,77975,-2.2798481,50.2126999,77834,-2.29113007,50.2120209,77694,-2.3025701,50.2113113,77535,-2.31543994,50.2105484,77404,-2.3260529,50.2099419,77274,-2.3365519,50.2093391,77125,-2.34863997,50.2086716,77004,-2.35837293,50.2081108,76853,-2.37052989,50.2074089,76704,-2.38257694,50.2067719,76565,-2.39378691,50.2061195,76414,-2.40598512,50.205471,76274,-2.41733193,50.2048798,76134,-2.42869306,50.2042885,75974,-2.44166803,50.2036285,75825,-2.45375299,50.2029915,75685,-2.4651351,50.2024384,75544,-2.47660995,50.201889,75415,-2.487185,50.2013512,75222,-2.5038321,50.2005196,75076,-2.51533198,50.1998901,74925,-2.52765298,50.1992302,74785,-2.53923297,50.1985817,74655,-2.55005789,50.1979294,74505,-2.56247497,50.1972504,74364,-2.57421994,50.1965599,74224,-2.58597302,50.1959,74014,-2.60341501,50.1949005,73864,-2.61592793,50.1942101,73724,-2.62770009,50.1935616,73574,-2.64031005,50.1928482,73354,-2.6588769,50.1918907,73214,-2.67075801,50.1912994,73064,-2.68343711,50.1906395,72904,-2.69714999,50.1899796,72755,-2.70996809,50.1893082,72625,-2.72099805,50.1887703,72495,-2.73218203,50.188221,72274,-2.75122309,50.1871796,72127,-2.76497293,50.1863289,71975,-2.77705789,50.1855698,71845,-2.78828192,50.1848717,71694,-2.80134702,50.1840286,71497,-2.8187151,50.1829185,71365,-2.82991004,50.1822586,71225,-2.84205294,50.1815186,71014,-2.86046791,50.1803398,70865,-2.87349701,50.179451,70723,-2.88593507,50.1785889,70585,-2.89801788,50.1777496,70444,-2.91052008,50.1768684,70295,-2.92352796,50.1760101,70145,-2.93675494,50.1750984,69945,-2.95444989,50.1739311,69796,-2.96767306,50.1730804,69675,-2.9783299,50.1723518,69515,-2.99254799,50.1715317,69344,-3.00786996,50.1708488,69204,-3.02035189,50.170269,69054,-3.0337131,50.169651,68894,-3.04833293,50.1689606,68735,-3.06226802,50.1683006,68595,-3.0746901,50.1677208,68445,-3.08808994,50.167099,68265,-3.10422492,50.1663284,68125,-3.11677194,50.1657104,67994,-3.12853193,50.1651382,67844,-3.14209795,50.1644592,67705,-3.15455294,50.1638107,67565,-3.16723704,50.1631699,67354,-3.18635297,50.1621513,67215,-3.19878292,50.1614494,67085,-3.21053195,50.160759,66955,-3.22226691,50.160099,66795,-3.23673511,50.1592598,66665,-3.24846792,50.1585808,66524,-3.26119304,50.1578293,66334,-3.27840996,50.1568298,66194,-3.29112792,50.15625,65974,-3.31101489,50.1553688,65844,-3.32283807,50.1550293,65714,-3.33457494,50.1546593,65494,-3.35450506,50.1539497,65345,-3.368083,50.1533699,65144,-3.38652802,50.1525917,65005,-3.39934993,50.1520195,64865,-3.41221189,50.1515083,64744,-3.42323709,50.1510696,64604,-3.43603802,50.1504898,64454,-3.45001292,50.1498299,64333,-3.46110511,50.1493492,64185,-3.47483993,50.1487389,64044,-3.48797202,50.1481285,63894,-3.50197005,50.1474113,63735,-3.51674008,50.1466103,63574,-3.53157997,50.1458893,63424,-3.54548001,50.1451988,63224,-3.56406307,50.1441994,63085,-3.57695508,50.1434898,62935,-3.59081006,50.1427193,62735,-3.60936689,50.1416588,62575,-3.62436295,50.14077,62382,-3.64221311,50.1397095,62244,-3.65524292,50.1389618,62104,-3.66838002,50.1382484,61894,-3.68814993,50.1371994,61745,-3.70202208,50.1364517,61585,-3.71702504,50.135601,61445,-3.73012996,50.1347389,61325,-3.74119306,50.1340218,61124,-3.75919509,50.1358795,60935,-3.77599692,50.1390305,60794,-3.78898501,50.1414719,60644,-3.80206203,50.1439095,60495,-3.81540298,50.1463585,60365,-3.82716489,50.1485214,60156,-3.84608197,50.1521301,60028,-3.85771799,50.1543808,59905,-3.86865807,50.1565399,59762,-3.8812449,50.1590385,59641,-3.89198804,50.1611595,59435,-3.91068792,50.1648483,59295,-3.923172,50.1673508,59146,-3.93647003,50.1702309,59006,-3.94887304,50.1728897,58881,-3.95978498,50.175209,58754,-3.97133994,50.1776886,58531,-3.99077797,50.1819992,58364,-4.00115681,50.1892319,58226,-4.00963402,50.1954613,58095,-4.01848507,50.2007103,57925,-4.03009701,50.2075882,57786,-4.03958511,50.2132683,57655,-4.04801512,50.2188301,57454,-4.06064796,50.2276382,57295,-4.06993008,50.2348404,57115,-4.080472,50.24306,56914,-4.092323,50.25226,56775,-4.100435,50.25866,56643,-4.108083,50.26479,56485,-4.117332,50.27229,56343,-4.125683,50.27906,56205,-4.133692,50.28563,56065,-4.14169,50.29222,55925,-4.148395,50.299,55795,-4.151242,50.30577,55644,-4.151649,50.31295,55517,-4.151767,50.31573,55290,-4.15048,50.31558,55111,-4.150273,50.31523,54930,-4.149913,50.31489,54750,-4.14951,50.31484,54212,-4.148823,50.31516,52952,-4.148883,50.31519,51693,-4.148716,50.31505,50434,-4.148757,50.31509,49166,-4.148765,50.31508,47735,-4.148708,50.31503,46289,-4.148716,50.31496,45031,-4.148687,50.31497,43769,-4.148672,50.31495,42511,-4.148955,50.31526,42330,-4.148818,50.31499,421

melody (\"singing, chanting\"),[1] also tune, voice, or line, is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity. In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include successions of other musical elements such as tonal color. It may be considered the foreground to the background accompaniment. A line or part need not be a foreground melody.Melodies often consist of one or more musical phrases or motifs, and are usually repeated throughout a composition in various forms. Melodies may also be described by their melodic motion or the pitches or the intervals between pitches (predominantly conjunct or disjunct or with further restrictions), pitch range, tension and release, continuity and coherence, cadence, and shape.The true goal of music—its proper enterprise—is melody. All the parts of harmony have as their ultimate purpose only beautiful melody. Therefore, the question of which is the more significant, melody or harmony, is futile. Beyond doubt, the means is subordinate to the end.Melody can also be a name meaning \"music\"Given the many and varied elements and styles of melody \"many extant explanations [of melody] confine us to specific stylistic models, and they are too exclusive.\"[3] Paul Narveson claimed in 1984 that more than three-quarters of melodic topics had not been explored thoroughly.[4]The melodies existing in most European music written before the 20th century, and popular music throughout the 20th century, featured \"fixed and easily discernible frequency patterns\", recurring \"events, often periodic, at all structural levels\" and \"recurrence of durations and patterns of durations\".[3]Melodies in the 20th century \"utilized a greater variety of pitch resources than ha[d] been the custom in any other historical period of Western music.\" While the diatonic scale was still used, the chromatic scale became \"widely employed.\"[3] Composers also allotted a structural role to \"the qualitative dimensions\" that previously had been \"almost exclusively reserved for pitch and rhythm\". Kliewer states, \"The essential elements of any melody are duration, pitch, and quality (timbre), texture, and loudness.[3] Though the same melody may be recognizable when played with a wide variety of timbres and dynamics, the latter may still be an \"element of linear ordering\"[3]Different musical styles use melody in different ways.

The game requires no reading and minimal counting skills, making it suitable for young children. Due to the design of the game, there is no strategy involved: players are never required to make choices, just follow directions. The winner is predetermined by the shuffle of the cards. A perennial favorite, the game sells about one million copies per year. The race is woven around a storyline about finding King Kandy, the lost king of Candy Land. The board consists of a winding, linear track made of 134 spaces, most red, green, blue, yellow, orange or purple. The remaining pink spaces are named locations such as Candy Cane Forest and Gum Drop Mountain, or characters such as Queen Frostine and Gramma Nutt.Players take turns removing the top card from a stack, most of which show one of six colors, and then moving their marker ahead to the next space of that color. Some cards have two marks of a color, in which case the player moves the marker ahead to the second-next space of that color. The deck has one card for each named location, and drawing such a card moves a player directly to that board location. This move can be either forward or backward in the classic game; backward moves can be ignored for younger players in the 2004 version of the game.Prior to the 2006 edition, the board had three colored spaces marked with a dot. Two of these spaces were designated as \"cherry pitfalls\" and the other was situated in Molasses Swamp. A player who lands on such a space is stuck (all cards are ignored) until a card is drawn of the same color as the square. In the 2006 version, dot spaces were replaced with licorice spaces that prompt the player landing on it to simply lose the next turn.The game is won by landing on or passing the final square and thus reaching the goal of the Candy Castle; the official rules specify that any card that would cause the player to advance past the last square wins the game, but many play so that one must land exactly on the last square to win. The 2004 version changed the last space from a violet square to a rainbow space, meaning it applies to any color drawn by a player, thus resolving any dispute about exactly who wins the game.As of 2013, Candy Land is being sold by Hasbro with a spinner instead of cards. The spinner includes all outcomes that were previously on the cards.History: The game was designed in 1948 by Eleanor Abbott, while she was recovering from polio in San Diego, California. The game was made for and tested by the children in the same wards on the hospital. The children suggested that Abbott submit the game to Milton Bradley Company. The game was bought by Milton Bradley and first published in 1949 as a temporary fill in for their then main product line, school supply. Candy Land became Milton Bradley's best selling game surpassing its previous top seller, Uncle Wiggly, and put the company in the same league as its main competitor, Parker Brothers. The original art has been purported to be by Abbott, but who the artist was remains a mystery. In 1984, Hasbro purchased Milton Bradley.Landmark Entertainment Group revamped the game with new art, adding characters and a story line in 1984.Hasbro produces several versions of the game and treats it as a brand. For example, they market Candy Land puzzles, a travel version,[citation needed] a personal computer game, and a handheld electronic version.Candy Land was involved in one of the first disputes over internet domain names in 1996. An adult web content provider registered candyland.com, and Hasbro objected.

It is currently in the G-cloud—a nearby accumulation of gas and dust known as an interstellar cloud.[12][13] Altair is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77 and is one of the vertices of the asterism known as the Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are marked by Deneb and Vega).[4][14][15] It is 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from the Sun and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye.[16]Altair rotates rapidly, with a velocity at the equator of approximately 286 km/s.[nb 2][6] This is a significant fraction of the star's estimated breakup speed of 400 km/s.[9] A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation.[17] Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon.[6]α Aquilae (Latinised to Alpha Aquilae) is the star's Bayer designation. The traditional name Altair has been used since medieval times. It is an abbreviation of the Arabic phrase النسر الطائر, al-nesr al-ṭā’ir (\"the flying eagle\"). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)[18] to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016[19] included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Altair for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.[20]Along with Beta Aquilae and Gamma Aquilae, Altair forms the well-known line of stars sometimes referred to as the Family of Aquila or Shaft of Aquila.[21]Altair is a type-A main sequence star with approximately 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and 11 times its luminosity.[6][7] Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours.[7] For comparison, the equator of the Sun requires a little more than 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.[6]Satellite measurements made in 1999 with the Wide Field Infrared Explorer showed that the brightness of Altair fluctuates slightly, varying by just a few thousandths of a magnitude with several different periods less than 2 hours.[5] As a result, it was identified in 2005 as a Delta Scuti variable star. Its light curve can be approximated by adding together a number of sine waves, with periods that range between 0.8 and 1.5 hours.[22] It is a weak source of coronal X-ray emission, with the most active sources of emission being located near the star's equator. This activity may be due to convection cells forming at the cooler equator.[9]The angular diameter of Altair was measured interferometrically by R. Hanbury Brown and his co-workers at Narrabri Observatory in the 1960s. They found a diameter of 3 milliarcseconds.[23] Although Hanbury Brown et al. realized that Altair would be rotationally flattened, they had insufficient data to experimentally observe its oblateness. Altair was later observed to be flattened by infrared interferometric measurements made by the Palomar Testbed Interferometer in 1999 and 2000. This work was published by G. T. van Belle, David R. Ciardi and their co-authors in 2001.[17]Theory predicts that, owing to Altair's rapid rotation, its surface gravity and effective temperature should be lower at the equator, making the equator less luminous than the poles. This phenomenon, known as gravity darkening or the von Zeipel effect, was confirmed for Altair by measurements made by the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer in 2001, and analyzed by Ohishi et al. (2004) and Peterson et al. (2006).[7][24] Also, A. Domiciano de Souza et al. (2005) verified gravity darkening using the measurements made by the Palomar and Navy interferometers, together with new measurements made by the VINCI instrument at the VLTI.[25]Altair is one of the few stars for which a direct image has been obtained.[26] In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his coworkers produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the Sun, had been imaged.[26] The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator.[6] The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.[9]The term Al Nesr Al Tair appeared in Al Achsasi al Mouakket's catalogue, which was translated into Latin as Vultur Volans.[27] This name was applied by the Arabs to the asterism of α, β, and γ Aquilae and probably goes back to the ancient Babylonians and Sumerians, who called α Aquilae the eagle star.[28] The spelling Atair has also been used.[29] Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe depicted Altair and Vega as birds.[30]The Koori people of Victoria also knew Altair as Bunjil, the wedge-tailed eagle, and β and γ Aquilae are his two wives the black swans. The people of the Murray River knew the star as Totyerguil.[31] The Murray River was formed when Totyerguil the hunter speared Otjout, a giant Murray cod, who, when wounded, churned a channel across southern Australia before entering the sky as the constellation Delphinus.[32]In Chinese, the asterism consisting of α, β, and γ Aquilae is known as Hé Gǔ (河鼓; lit. \"river drum\").[29] Altair is thus known as Hé Gǔ èr (河鼓二; lit. \"river drum two\", meaning the \"second star of the drum at the river\").[33] However, Altair is better known by its other names: Qiān Niú Xīng (牵牛星) or Niú Láng Xīng (牛郎星), translated as the cowherd star.[34][35] These names are an allusion to a love story, The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd, in which Niulang (represented by Altair) and his two children (represented by β and γ Aquilae) are separated from respectively their wife and mother Zhinu (represented by Vega) by the Milky Way. They are only permitted to meet once a year, when magpies form a bridge to allow them to cross the Milky Way.[35][36]The people of Micronesia called Altair Mai-lapa, meaning \"big/old breadfruit\", while the Māori people called this star Poutu-te-rangi, meaning \"pillar of heaven\".[37]In Western astrology, the star Altair was ill-omened, portending danger from reptiles.[29]Japan Airlines's Starjet 777-200 JA8983 was named Altair.Altair Airlines was a regional airline that operated out of Philadelphia from 1966 to 1982.The NASA Constellation Program announced Altair as the name of the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) on December 13, 2007.[38] The Russian-made Beriev Be-200 Altair seaplane is also named after the star.[39]The Altair 8800 was one of the first microcomputers intended for home use.Altair is the name of three United States navy ships: USS Altair (AD-11), USS Altair (AK-257) and USNS Altair (T-AKR-291).Altair is the name of a 1919 poem by Karle Wilson Baker.Three of them walk together- She is the fairest of three; And sweet as the heavenly weather She maketh the heart of me!\"[40]The bright primary star has the multiple star designation WDS 19508+0852A and has three faint visual companion stars, WDS 19508+0852B, C, and D.

I SOLER","text":"MARTIN I SOLER:Vicent Martín i Soler (València, 2 de maig de 1754 - Sant Petersburg, 30 de gener de 1806),[1] compositor valencià famós per les seves més de trenta òperes estrenades a Nàpols, Viena i Sant Petersburg, i una vintena de ballets.[2]Entre els sis i quinze anys cantà al cor de la catedral de València. A partir de 1775 es traslladà a Madrid i hi estrenà la que possiblement sigui la seva primera òpera, Il tutore burlato, després traduïda al castellà i adaptada en forma de sarsuela amb el títol de La Madrileña. A Madrid obtingué el favor del futur Carles IV i finalment es traslladà a Nàpols, a treballar amb la família reial (també borbònica).Entre 1777 i 1785 Martín i Soler treballà a Nàpols, anys en què va consolidar la seva formació i va afermar la seva fama com a compositor. El 1779 aconseguí estrenar una òpera, Ifigenia in Aulide al gran teatre San Carlo. Els anys següents la seva fama augmentà a tota Itàlia i les seves òperes es començaren a representar a altres ciutats (Andrómaca, L'amore geloso, In amor ci vuol destrezza i Le burle per amore, entre d'altres).El 1785 rebé una oferta per instal·lar-se a Viena i s'hi traslladà. A Viena, gran capital de l'òpera italiana en aquells moments, Martín i Soler, que era el favorit de Josep II, amplià el seu cercle musical i féu ràpidament amistat amb el gran llibretista Lorenzo da Ponte, amb qui col·laborà en cinc òperes. El 1786 ja estrenà l'òpera Il burbero di buon cuore i tot seguit Una cosa rara, el seu èxit més espectacular, L'isola del piacere, i L'arbore de Diana. Segons el nombre de representacions a la cort, només superat algun any per Giovanni Paisiello, sembla que era el preferit del públic de Viena, per davant de Salieri i Mozart.A finals d'estiu de 1788 li va arribar una oferta de la tsarina Caterina II per nomenar-lo compositor de la cort russa, oferta que acceptà. A Sant Petersburg compongué noves òperes, vegades en rus, com Gorè Bogatyr Kossomètovitx («El desgraciat heroi Kossomètovitx») amb libreto de la pròpia tsarina, i representà les seves òperes italianes anteriors. Entre 1793 i 1796 residí a Londres, on estrenà La capricciosa corretta també amb text de Da Ponte, que fracassà i l'obligà a retornar a Sant Petersburg. A Sant Petersburg també compongué diversos ballets, com Didon abandonée (1792), Amour et Psyché (1793, basat en Psyché de Molière, Corneille i Quinault), Tancrède (1799) i Le retour de Poliorcète (1799). Els darrers anys a Rússia es dedicà bàsicament a l'ensenyament i compongué relativament poc. Morí el 30 de gener de 1806 a Sant Petersburg; és enterrat al cementiri de Wassiliewskij Ostrow.La Dora festeggiante (Torí, 1783), amb poesia de Cesare Olivieri, i Il Sogno (Viena, 1787/1789), amb poesia de Martín i Soler amb Da Ponte, són les dues úniques cantates que es conserven de Martín i Soler..

P","text":"BARBARA P:Barbara (París, 9 de juny de 1930 - Neuilly-sur-Seine, 24 novembre de 1997) va ser una cantant i compositora francesa, nascuda com Mónica Andrée Serf.De 1950 al 1952 va viure a Brussel·les, i estudia al col·legi NSM on es va convertir en membre de la comunitat artística. Després d'uns començaments difícils en diversos cabarets belgues, es va presentar a París, a l'Ecluse, el 1958. En aquella època es acompanyava al piano i interpretava cançons de Georges Brassens, Jacques Brel i autors de principis de segle, sobretot Xarnof ( autor del \"Fiacre\") i Fragson. Va començar a cantar les seves pròpies composicions i l'èxit va cridar a la seva porta al començament de la dècada de 1960 amb una de les cançons més conegudes de la seva discografia: Dis, quand reviendras-el teu? (1963). D'aquesta manera, va passar dels cabarets als grans teatres: la Sala Bobino, després l'Olympia de París i més endavant el Zénith. Els seus amics, pintors i escriptors, van convertir una casa antiga en estudis amb un vestíbul per a concerts on Barbara interpretava al piano les cançons d'Édith Piaf, Juliette Gréco i Germaine Montero.En octubre de 1953 es casa amb Claude Juan Lucas Sluys, 1 belga estudiant de Dret del que se separa en 1956. de retorn a París va conèixer a Jacques Brel, amb qui va entaular gran amistat i interpretaria diverses de les seves cançons. Més tard va ser presentada a Georges Brassens. Va oferir en aquells dies presentacions en petits cabarets on va començar a congregar un públic fidel, en particular entre els estudiants del barri llatí de París. En 1957, va tornar a Brussel·les per gravar el seu primer disc, però no va ser abans de 1961 que coneixeria la fama, començant a actuar a la Sala Bobino a Montparnasse.

o bus és un vehicle terrestre llarg dissenyat per a portar nombrosos passatgers a més del conductor i de vegades del revisor o un cobrador de bitllets. El mot és un versió neològica del llatí omnibus, que significava \"per a tothom\".El 1662 Blaise Pascal inventa un sistema de bus tirat per cavalls amb ruta regular, horari i tarifes a París.[1]L'Omnibus, va ser el primer sistema de transport públic organitzat, va aparèixer per primera vegada a Nantes, França, el 1826. Quan Stanislas Baudry, un oficial retirar de l'exèrcit qui havia construït uns banys públics a la vora de la ciutat, en un curt recorregut en línia recta entre la ciutat i els banys. El servei començava a l'espai de Comerç, a fora de la botiga de barrets de M. Omnès, que mostrava el lema de Omnès Omnibus (\"Omnès per a tots\") en el rètol del negoci.Els autobusos són una part intrínseca de la vida quotidiana, i juguen un paper fonamental en l'estructura social de molts països. Molts sistemes de transport públics urbans depenen del servei d'autobusos.El servei d'autobusos pot disposar de diverses amples classes. Els autobusos de trànsit locals ofereixen un servei de trànsit públic dins d'una ciutat, normalment són viatges de només uns quants quilòmetres. Els interurbans, interprovincials o interestatals proporcionen un trànsit de bus entre ciutats i àrees rurals. Aquestes línies d'autobús tenen un trajecte normalment de desenes o centenars de quilòmetres de distància. Generalment aquests últims ofereixen menys parades d'autobús que no les línies d'autobusos locals. El servei d'autobusos interurbans s'ha convertit en una connexió de viatge molt important a les ciutats més petites o a poblacions sense servei ferroviari ni aeroports.El servei d'autobusos llançadora proporciona trànsit directe entre dues destinacions, sense cap o gairebé cap parada intermèdia, com ara de l'aeroport fins a la ciutat. El servei d'autobusos llançadora sol ser utilitzat per escoles, aeroports, àrees de compra i empreses.El servei turístic d'autobusos el formen autobusos que recorren tots els llocs notables o turístics de la ciutat o poble. En aquest tipus de serveis d'autobusos existeix la figura d'un guia que simplement descriu els llocs que es veuen des de l'autobús. També hi ha altres autobusos turístics que paren a cada punt d'interès, que normalment són molt més llargs de durada i recorregut. Hi ha alguns serveis d'autobusos turístics que fins i tot són decorats com si fossin tramvies, normalment per atreure turistes. Un fenomen similar són els serveis d'autobusos anomenats Duck Tours (Visites Ànec), que consisteix a utilitzar els DUKW (pronunciat en angles duck, ànec) que són vehicles amfibis convertits en autobusos vaixells o creuers per propòsits turístics. Actualment als Països Catalans no existeix aquest tipus de servei, només a ciutats com Londres o Liverpool.El servei escolar d'autobusos proporciona trànsit des de l'escola a casa o a la parada d'autobús escolar més propera de l'estudiant, i viceversa. Algunes escoles privades utilitzen autobusos escolars només per a viatges de camp o esdeveniments esportius.El servei nocturn d'autobusos opera només de nit. Moltes ciutats tenen aquest servei, sigui complementant o substituint el servei d'autobusos diürn ordinari o el servei de ferrocarril, pel manteniment o a causa de l'escassetat de viatgers a la nit. Vegeu, per exemple, el servei d'autobusos nocturns a l'Àmbit metropolità de Barcelona.Existeixen diferents tipus d'autobusos com per a petites distàncies com per a llargues, autobusos diaris com autobusos especials amb fins específics.","path":[58920,2.179015,41.37526,57720,2.17903,41.37525,57480,2.181905,41.37392,57120,2.182998,41.37367,56880,2.181022,41.36413,56580,2.173767,41.35311,56280,2.16867,41.34828,55980,2.172972,41.35865,55680,2.180932,41.36484,55380,2.181397,41.37379,54780,2.178998,41.37531,53280,2.179008,41.37534,51780,2.178985,41.37529,50520,2.179007,41.37532,50280,2.182335,41.3738,49920,2.183855,41.37251,49680,2.182477,41.36563,49380,2.174412,41.35486,49080,2.168317,41.34666,48780,2.173537,41.35664,48480,2.17959,41.36303,48180,2.181562,41.37363,47880,2.179027,41.37533,46680,2.179028,41.37533,46380,2.185572,41.37682,46020,2.184652,41.36818,45780,2.179482,41.36232,45480,2.172803,41.35158,45180,2.170233,41.35061,44880,2.177562,41.36019,44580,2.182735,41.36975,43380,2.17904,41.37533,43080,2.180362,41.37472,42780,2.184147,41.37466,42480,2.181485,41.36483,42180,2.175143,41.35539,41880,2.169138,41.34898,41580,2.172935,41.35881,41280,2.181578,41.36546,40920,2.179457,41.37486,39720,2.179012,41.37526,39480,2.179022,41.37528,39180,2.185382,41.37565,38880,2.182308,41.36602,38580,2.174873,41.35542,38220,2.168157,41.34793,37920,2.17302,41.35789,37680,2.180418,41.36422,37380,2.181567,41.3736,36780,2.179028,41.37529,35280,2.179007,41.3753,33720,2.179023,41.37529,32520,2.179005,41.37526,31320,2.179017,41.37528,29820,2.179017,41.37528]},{"name":"SNAV SARDEGNA","text":"SNAV SARDEGNA:MS SNAV Sardegna és un cruiseferry propietat de la SNAV amb seu a Itàlia i operat en els seus serveis d'Olbia-Civitavecchia i Palerm-Civitavecchia.

Aérospatiale SA 321 Super Frelon ( 'vespa' en francès) és un helicòpter de transport militar pesat de tres motors produït per la companyia francesa Aérospatiale. Aquest helicòpter encara està sent fabricat a la Xina, on es produeix una versió local coneguda com Z-8.Derivado del més petit Sud-Aviation SA 3200 Frelon, helicòpter mitjà de transport que va volar per primera vegada el 10 de juny de 1959, el Aérospatiale SA 321 Super Frelon va ser dissenyat amb assistència tècnica de la Sikorsky Aircraft d'EUA i construït en cooperació amb la Fiat Avio d'Itàlia. En conseqüència, la sèrie SA321 inclou algunes característiques típiques dels Sikorsky, com ara el casc hermètic per a operacions amfíbies, les càmeres d'aire de flotació que allotgen el tren d'aterratge principal, i un sistema rotor dissenyat per Sikorsky.El primer prototip Super Frelon , denominat originàriament SA 3210-01, va volar el 7 de desembre de 1962, equipat amb tres motors Turboméca Turmo IIIC2 de 1.320 CV, en versió equipada per a transport de tropa. Al juliol de 1963, aquest aparell va establir diversos rècords internacionals per a helicòpters, entre ells una velocitat de 341 km / h en un circuit de 3 km, i una velocitat de 350,47 km / h en un circuit de 15/25 km.El segon prototip que va volar el 28 maig 1963 era la versió navalizada i presentava flotadors estabilitzadors en els suports del tren d'aterratge principal. Van seguir a aquest quatre exemplars de preproducció SA 321 i un encàrrec de l'Aéronavale de 17 unitats, denominades SA 321G. Aquesta versió va ser especialment dissenyada per a missions de patrulla marítima / antisubmarino i es va convertir en la primera sèrie de producció. El prototip SA 321G volar el 30 de novembre de 1965, i els lliuraments De producció van començar a principis de 1966. Aquests helicòpters portaven un equip complet de guerra antisubmarina; la secció de cua es plegava i els amortidors del tren inferior de tres rodes podien baixar per facilitar la seva almacenamiento.La versió comercial SA 321F, amb cabina per a 37 passatgers, va volar per primera vegada el 7 d'abril de 1967 i va ser aprovada pel servei de passatgers el juny de 1968.

40° 43′ 00″ N, 24° 46′ 00″ E﻿ / ﻿40.71667°N,24.76667°E﻿ / 40.71667; 24.76667Tassos o Thassos (també Tasos o Thasos) (en català medieval: Taix, en turc Tashoz) és una illa del nord de la mar Egea, a la costa de Tràcia, de 394 km². El seu nom català (antic) fou Taix. Era part de la regió de Macedònia i de l'antiga prefectura de Kavala, però a partir de l'1 de gener de 2011, segons el programa Cal·lícrates, forma la unitat perifèrica de Tassos, després de la divisió de la prefectura de Kavala en dues unitats perifèriques: la de Tassos i la de Kavala. El seu punt més elevat és el puig antigament conegut com a Ipsarió, de 1.028 m. L'illa és circular i s'hi cultiva la vinya i l'olivera. El marbre gairebé no s'explota i les mines de l'illa estan exhaurides o són poc rendibles.La capital actual n'és Limin. La ciutat de Tassos estava situada al nord de l'illa, i tenia dos ports i encara es veuen restes de les antigues muralles enmig de torres construïdes pels venecians. A la rodalia, hi ha una estàtua del déu Pan tallada a la roca.Anteriorment l'illa fou anomenada Aethra i Chryse per les seves mines d'or i fou poblada per fenicis, suposadament per Thasos, fill d'Agenor, que va donar nom a l'illa. Vers una data entre el 720 aC i el 708 aC, fou poblada per grecs procedents de Paros, dirigits per Telesicles, pare del poeta Arquiloc. També vivien a l'illa els saians, una tribu tràcia, que es van enfrontar als grecs, però finalment aquestos van obtenir la possessió de l'illa amb les seves mines de Scapte Hyle, i territoris a la costa continental, amb les mines a la costa tràcia de Galepsos, Oesyma, Stryme, Datum i, finalment (més tard), Crenides. El 511 aC, els milesis es van establir al riu Strymon i van fundar la ciutat de Myrcinos, on també es van explotar mines.El 494 aC, els perses van ocupar Milet i van intentar sotmetre Tassos sense èxit, però el 492 aC Darios I el gran els va comminar a desfer les fortificacions de l'illa i a enviar els seus vaixells de guerra a Abdera, i els illencs van haver d'obeir. Xerxes I de Pèrsia va passar per Tràcia cap a Grècia, els dessis de la part continental hi van quedar sotmesos i van haver de proveir el rei amb el manteniment dels soldats (400 talents). Després de la derrota persa, Tassos fou membre de la Confederació de Delos dirigida per Atenes, però van esclatar disputes per les mines de la part continental i va esclatar la guerra entre Tassos i Atenes, i aquesta darrera va enviar a l'illa una força dirigida per Cimó II, el 465 aC, que va derrotar els tassis i va desembarcar i assetjà la ciutat per terra i mar; el assetjats van resistir més de dos anys, però al tercer any de setge es van rendir i van haver de destruir les fortificacions i lliurar els seus vaixells de guerra a més de renunciar a les seves possessions del continent i pagar una contribució en metàl·lic (afegida al tribut anyal).El 411 aC, es va establir un govern oligàrquic dirigit per Pisandre a Atenes, i la democràcia a Tassos fou enderrocada. Però les lluites a Atenes (Alcibíades) que van portar a l'assassinat del cap oligarca Frinicos, van fer que el govern oligàrquic de Tassos es revoltés amb suport espartà, que van establir una guarnició a l'illa. El 408 aC, el partit dels ciutadans dirigit per Ecfantos va expulsar la guarnició espartana dirigida per Etònic i, seguidament, va rebre el comandant atenenc Trasibul. Després de la Batalla d'Egospòtam (405 aC), Tassos va tornar a mans dels espartans, però el 389 aC va tornar a ser possessió dels atenencs als quals la va disputar Filip de Macedònia, sota dependència del qual finalment va passar, vers el 351 aC. Ciutat lliure des del temps d'Alexandre el Gran, es va sotmetre a Filip V de Macedònia.Els romans li van tornar la llibertat després de la Batalla de Cinoscèfals, i va romandre ciutat lliure fins al temps de Plini el Vell, quan es va formar la província romana de les Illes.Possessió de l'Imperi bizantí, fou ocupada pels llatins el 1205 i va passar als venecians, que la van donar en feu als Dandolo; Miquel VIII Paleòleg (1259-1282) la va recuperar per als bizantins i, el 1386, la va concedir en feu als Gattiluso. Fou ocupada pels otomans el 1456, que temps després la van cedir als prínceps venecians Gateluzi de Lesbos. Des del 1453, fou un virtual domini turc, on els Gattiluso van poder restar per concessió. El senyor Dorino I Gattiluso, que governava Lesbos, Lemnos, Imbros, Thasos i Samotràcia, va morir el 30 de juny del 1455 i va deixar tres fills i tres filles; dels tres fills, dos foren senyors de Lesbos, Domenicco I Gattiluso i Nicolo II Gattiluso, mentre el tercer, Francesc III Gattiluso, fou senyor de Thasos. El 1459, Thasos, Samotràcia i Lemnos foren ocupades pels otomans i el soldà en va donar els ingressos al seu sogre, l'antic dèspota de Morea, Demetri Paleòleg. Després de la guerra amb Venècia (1463-1479), va quedar plenament integrada a l'Imperi. Depenia del sandjakbegi de Kavala, que hi enviava un voivoda. El 1770 i fins a 1774, fou ocupada pels russos després de la victòria naval de Çeşme; la van fer servir com a base per a la seva flota.El 1841, el soldà la va cedir com a propietat personal al virrei d'Egipte, els avantpassats del qual eren originaris de l'illa (on Muhammad Ali havia passat la infància), i fou administrada per un governador egipci, amb un president del consell elegit pels habitants. El 1873, el khediv va enviar un carregament de blat a causa de la manca de menjar per les males collites. La situació, això no obstant, es va deteriorar i els habitants progressivament es van distanciar de la dinastia egípcia a partir del 1874, fins que el 1902 van demanar al soldà el restabliment del poder turc, que fou atorgat.

El municipi de Montclar té l'enclavament de Sant Quintí de Montclar. El poble, que és dalt d'una serra, s'estructura a l'entorn d'una plaça, en un extrem de la qual hi ha l'església parroquial i, al davant, la casa senyorial coneguda com el castell.L'església parroquial està dedicada a Sant Martí. És d'estil romànic i va ser construïda al segle XII. És de nau única amb absis. Té annex un campanar de planta quadrada amb coberta a quatre aigües. Al seu interior es conserven dos retaules barrocs així com un altre d'estil neoclàssic. L'edifici va ser reformat completament la dècada de 1970. En el mateix terme municipal hi ha dues esglésies romàniques. La de la Santa Creu és de nau única i té un campanar d'espadanya.[3]L' església de Sant Quintí de Montclar és també d'una sola nau, coberta amb volta de canó. Té un absis semicircular cobert amb volta de quart d'esfera. Al seu interior hi havia una lipsanoteca del segle XI que actualment es conserva al Museu Diocesà i Comarcal de Solsona. Montclar celebra la seva festa major al mes de gener, coincidint amb la festivitat de Sant Sebastià.L'activitat econòmica dels terme es basa únicament en l'agricultura, bàsicament de secà (blat, civada, patates, blat de moro, farratges), la ramaderia i l'explotació forestal.Montclar és documentat des del segle XI, però el castell pròpiament no surt esmentat fins al 1309, quan passà a domini reial (era regentat per la família dels Montclar) i s'engrandí. El segle XVII, quan era propietat de la família nobiliària dels Tamarit, l'antic castell fou transformat en masia, coneguda com cal Metge Sastret. Aquest conjunt fou declarat bé d'interès cultural el 1985.[3] La major part dels habitatges es van construir els segles XVII i XVIII, moment en què la població augmentà considerablement. Actualment, molts d'aquests, avui restaurats, constitueixen segones

Comprèn els departaments de Dordonya, Gironda, Landes, Olt i Garona i Pirineus Atlàntics. La capital és Bordeus. El mot Aquitània prové del llatí Aquitainia, derivat de dues arrels precèltiques, que volen dir \"proper al mar\". En occità gascó, Aquitània es diu Aquitània [akiˈtanjɔ], en basc Akitania i en poiteví-saintongès Aguiéne.Antigament va ser un ducat que comprenia la Septimània i Gòtia, des del 781, i després un regne erigit per Pipí, fill de Lluís el Pietós, que més tard derivà en ducat. Per la successió feudal va passar a Anglaterra i finalment va retornar a França.La regió apareix al començament de la història poblada per tribus que segurament eren d'origen iber, però anomenades simplement aquitanes. Eren unes trenta i entre elles hi havia les següents:Juli Cèsar va encarregar a Crasus de sotmetre Aquitània. A la batalla de Sos els sotiats foren derrotats. Crasus va continuar la seva feina i va anar dominant el país. El 27 aC la Gàl·lia es va dividir en tres províncies: la Gàl·lia Aquitània (amb capital a Burdigala, l'antiga Bordeus), la Gàl·lia Celta i la Gàl·lia Belga.Al segle II la part sud de la província es va convertir en la província de Novempopulània (més tard Aquitania Tertia) separada de la resta de la Gàl·lia Aquitània. La resta es va dividir vers el 370 en dues províncies: Aquitania Prima (al nord-est, amb capital a Bourges) i Aquitania Secunda (al nord-oest, amb capital a Burdigala, l'antiga Bordeus).El 297 Dioclecià va dividir la Gàl·lia en 120 ciutats repartides en 17 províncies. La Novempopulania tenia 12 ciutats.Ocupada pels visigots el 412 el rei Walia (415-418) es va fer reconèixer senyor de l'Aquitània Secunda per l'emperador Honori. A la caiguda de l'Imperi romà tota la regió passa a formar part del regne dels visigots amb capital a Tolosa 460. El 507 els visigots foren derrotats a Vouillé pels francs i perderen la regió.El 511 el tron visigot havia estat disputat al jove Amalaric (tutelat pel seu avi el rei ostrogot Teodoric el Gran) pel pretendent i això havia liquidar qualsevol pretensió visigoda de recuperar el poder a Aquitània, tot i que els francs encara no n'havien consolidat el control. Des l'any 511 Aquitània fou un domini compartit dels quatre fills del rei franc Clodoveu I: Teodoric I de Reims, Clodomir I d'Orleans, Khildebert I de París i Clotari I de Soissons. Mort Clodomir el 524 i Teodoric el 534, el país quedà en mans de Khildebert I i Clotari. Foren aquests reis que el 541 van fer una expedició militar a Pamplona i Saragossa, que no va reeixir.El 517 els francs guerrejaren amb els turingis i el 523 amb els borgonyons, pels quals van ser derrotats (524) amb la mort en combat del rei Clodomir d'Orleans. El 531 Teodoric de Reims i Clotari de Soissons-Orleans van fer la guerra altre cop a Turíngia i alhora Khildebert I de París es va apoderar d'Alvèrnia, que pertanyia a Thierry, que va haver d'anar precipitadament a la regió per reconquerir-la. Khildebert portava una política expansionista que el va portar també a fer la guerra contra els visigots, als quals va atacar a la Narbonense, atac en què va tenir el suport de Clotari de Soissons-Orleáns. El 532 Teodoric encara estava en guerra contra Turíngia, i Khildebert i Clotari van ocupar la Borgonya. Vers el 533 Teodoric va anar a Aquitània, però va morir el 534 deixant un fill, Teodobert, al qual els seus oncles Khildebert i Clotari van voler arrabassar l'herència; la guerra va acabar malament per als dos reis, que foren derrotats, i Teodobert va conservar els dominis paterns. Khildebert i Clotari es van aliar amb Teòdat, rei dels ostrogots, i van reprendre la guerra contra Teodobert el 535, lliurant-se els combats a la regió del Llemosí. L'hostilitat fou permanent, però la guerra fou de curta durada. Totes aquestes guerres van provocar que els bascons del sud dels Pirineus començaren a emigrar cap al nord i s'establiren a Aquitània, en un procés que sembla que fou lent, però continuat al llarg dels anys.El 555 va morir Teodebald de Reims-Metz, fill i successor de Teodobert. Clotari de Soissons-Orleans es va fer elegir rei de Reims i Metz i es va enfrontar amb son germà Khildebert de París. Un fill de Clotari anomenat Khrame, va aprofitar l'ocasió i amb suport de Khildebert es va revoltar i es va apoderar del Llemosí i del Chalonnais mentre es produïen atacs saxons al orient segurament també instigats per Khildebert. La guerra civil va durar fins al 557. Una treva es va establir i poc després, el 558, va morir Khildebert, i el va succeir Clotari que així va reunificar tots els territoris francs. Khrame, espoliat, es va rebel·lar de nou però al no tenir cap suport fou derrotat i assassinat.Clotari va morir el 561 i llavors es va produir un nou repartiment de territoris. El mateix any es van produir incursions dels avars que es van reproduir el següent any (562). Dos dels fills de Clotari es van enfrontar aviat en una guerra civil: Khilperic de Soissons va ocupar Reims, que pertanyia a son germà Sigebert que estava combatent als avars. Sigebert va retornar, va recuperar Reims i va marxar contra Soissons; després de diverses incidències es va acordar la pau (563). El 566 es va lliurar una guerra entre Austràsia (Reims) i Borgonya. Caribert de París va morir el 567 i Aquitània es va repartir entre Austràsia, Borgonya i Neústria (o Soissons). El 568 els austrasians van combatre contra els avars i contra els turingis, i poc després va esclatar un conflicte entre Austràsia i Neústria (o Soissons), i aquesta darrera va perdre la seva part d'Aquitània en favor d'Austràsia. El 573 i 574 es va lliurar una nova guerra entre Austràsia i Neústria. Durant el seu regnat Khilperic de Soissons (561-584) va lluitar contra els vascons que s'estaven instal·lant a Aquitània i ocupant moltes terres, però les dates precises no són conegudes, i només consten unes referències del poeta i bisbe gal Venanci Fortunat, que diu que el comites de Bordeus, Galactori, els va derrotar quant \"encara no havien creuat els Pirineus\", és a dir probablement quan encara només formaven grups reduïts d'emigrants i la invasió no havia estat massiva, o almenys limitada només a les dos vessants dels Pirineus.Els reis merovingis en van encarregar l'administració a ducs i el 574 el noble Desideri fou nomenat duc d'Aquitània. El 584, a la mort del rei merovingi Khilperic de Nèustria, el duc Desideri va donar suport a Gondobald, pretès fill de Clotari I (ex rei de Soissons) que estava refugiat a la cort de Bizanci i havia retornat a reclamar els seus drets, i que va obtenir també el de molts altres nobles com Gontrà Bosó, suposat duc d'Alvèrnia; Gondobald es va proclamar rei a Aquitània a la ciutat de Brive, però derrotat a Lugdunum Convenarum la rebel·lió es va acabar i molts dels nobles revoltats van ser executats (Gontrà Bosó va fugir); Desideri va ser perdonat per Fredegunda però a l'any següent va voler ampliar els seus dominis cap a la Septimània visigoda, que s'havia revoltat, i va morir en un combat a Carcassona el 587, i el domini merovingi a Aquitània va començar a desaparèixer.Sant Gregori de Tours en la seva \"Història dels francs\" i referint-se l'any 587 diu: \"els vascons es van precipitar des de les muntanyes a la plana, tallant les vinyes y destruint els camps, cremant les cases i emportant-se presoners a molts habitants i als seus ramats. El duc Astrovald els va fer la guerra sovint però fou molt petita la venjança que va exercir sobre ells\". D'això es desprendria que almenys des del 587 (probablement dels el 582 quant els visigots es van apoderar de part de les terres vascones al sud dels Pirineus) els vascons van baixar a les planes i com que feien presoners als habitants, als que s'emportaven a les muntanyes, la plana devia quedar buida afavorint més tard l'assentament dels vascons a la zona, segurament mitjançant un tractat o conveni que els hi assegurava la possessió de les terres a canvi de parar en els atacs.","path":[84720,2.175,41.35848,76080,2.175183,41.35888,69960,2.1751,41.35867,66720,2.175033,41.35863,65280,2.175083,41.35862,63660,2.1751,41.3586,62220,2.175067,41.35857,60960,2.175067,41.35858,59520,2.175,41.35867,58260,2.174967,41.35867,56820,2.174883,41.35855,55560,2.17505,41.3586,54120,2.174933,41.35852,52860,2.17505,41.3584,51420,2.175,41.35865,50160,2.175117,41.35873,48720,2.175017,41.35867,47460,2.175,41.35867,46020,2.174933,41.3586,44760,2.175183,41.35857,43320,2.174917,41.35903,42060,2.17515,41.35895,40620,2.175067,41.35835,39360,2.1749,41.35858,37920,2.175067,41.35863,36480,2.175033,41.3586,35220,2.17505,41.35872,33960,2.175133,41.35865,32520,2.175117,41.35862,31260,2.1748,41.35858,30000,2.17505,41.35863,28560,2.174967,41.35872,27120,2.17505,41.35865,25680,2.175033,41.35868,24420,2.175,41.35863,23160,2.175,41.35862,21900,2.174933,41.35858,20460,2.174967,41.3583,19200,2.174817,41.35842,17760,2.1751,41.35858,16500,2.174983,41.35865,15060,2.174983,41.35883,13620,2.174983,41.35858,12360,2.1753,41.3585,10020,2.175417,41.35868,3120,2.1738,41.3538,2880,2.171833,41.35073,2520,2.168833,41.34398,2160,2.167083,41.33555,1980,2.166283,41.33142,1740,2.165717,41.3248,1560,2.1686,41.31835,1320,2.173917,41.31332,1140,2.181167,41.31288,780,2.191117,41.3192,660,2.19215,41.32198,420,2.19265,41.3264,240,2.192767,41.32865]}]}
